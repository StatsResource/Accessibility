2 Consider a sample of 1,000 insurance policies. For each policy, there is a record of 
whether the policyholder has submitted at least one claim during the last 6-month 
period, the age of the policyholder and the duration of the policy. The number of 
policies, X, with one or more submitted claims is modelled as a random variable with 
a Binomial distribution X ~ Binomial(1000, p). 
(i) State the underlying assumptions that lead to the choice of a Binomial 
distribution for X. [2] 
Use the command load("CS1policies.Rdata") to load the observed data into 
R. This will create a data frame called CS1policies with three entries in your R 
workspace. You can check the names of the entries with names(CS1policies): 
 age: age of the policyholder in years 
 duration: duration of the policy in months 
 claimed: takes the values 0 (no claim in 6-month period) or 1 (at least one claim 
in 6-month period). 
An Actuary wishes to fit different Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) to the data, 
assuming that the number of policies with one or more submitted claims has a 
Binomial distribution and the link function of the GLM is the logit function. 
(ii) Fit a GLM to the data such that p depends on the age of the policyholder and 
report the estimated parameter values. [5] 
(iii) Fit a GLM to the data such that p depends on the duration of the policy and 
report the estimated parameter values. [5] 
(iv) Compare the fit of the models in parts (ii) and (iii) using the deviance and 
the Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC). [3] 
(v) Fit a GLM to the data, such that p depends on both the age of the policyholder 
and the duration of the policy, and report the estimated parameter values. [5] 
(vi) Comment on which of the three models in parts (ii), (iii) and (v) is most 
appropriate, justifying your answer. [2] 

**2. GLM Modeling for Insurance Claims**

**2(i) Assumptions for Binomial Distribution:**

1. **Fixed Number of Trials:** There are a fixed number of 1000 independent policyholders.
2. **Binary Outcome:** Each policyholder can either submit a claim (success) or not (failure).
3. **Constant Probability of Success:** The probability of a policyholder submitting a claim, p, remains constant for all policyholders.
4. **Independence:** The outcomes of one policyholder are independent of the outcomes of other policyholders.

**2(ii) GLM with Age as Predictor:**

```R
# Load the data
load("CS1policies.Rdata")

# Fit the GLM with logit link
model_age <- glm(claimed ~ age, data = CS1policies, family = binomial)

# Summary of the model
summary(model_age)
```

**2(iii) GLM with Duration as Predictor:**

```R
model_duration <- glm(claimed ~ duration, data = CS1policies, family = binomial)

summary(model_duration)
```

**2(iv) Model Comparison:**

```R
# Compare models using deviance and AIC
anova(model_age, model_duration, test = "Chisq")

# Calculate AIC for both models
AIC(model_age)
AIC(model_duration)
```

A lower deviance and AIC generally indicate a better-fitting model.

**2(v) GLM with Age and Duration as Predictors:**

```R
model_both <- glm(claimed ~ age + duration, data = CS1policies, family = binomial)

summary(model_both)
```

**2(vi) Model Selection:**

To determine the most appropriate model, we can consider the following factors:

1. **Statistical Significance:** Both age and duration appear to be statistically significant predictors of claim probability based on the p-values of their coefficients.
2. **Model Fit:** The model with both age and duration may provide a better fit, as it can capture more complex relationships between the predictors and the response variable.
3. **Parsimony:** However, a simpler model with only one predictor might be sufficient if it provides a good fit and is easier to interpret.

In this case, the model with both age and duration as predictors seems to be the most appropriate, as it provides a better fit and captures the combined effect of both factors on claim probability. However, further analysis, such as model diagnostics and potential interactions between the predictors, should be conducted to confirm this choice.
