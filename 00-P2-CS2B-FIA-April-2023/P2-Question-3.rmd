3 Before answering this question, the R packages for calculating and plotting Recursive
Partitioning and Regression Trees should be loaded into R using the following code:
install.packages("rpart")
install.packages("rpart.plot")
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
An insurance company is considering introducing a simplified underwriting process
for a health insurance product. The company is considering using monthly benefit
amount and another feature, ‘Feature1’, as criteria for determining which customers
are eligible for the simplified process. There is a further feature, ‘Feature2’, which the
company is prohibited by local regulations from using as a criterion.
In order to illustrate the issues involved in setting the eligibility criteria for the
simplified process, an Actuary engaged by the company generates a specimen data set
by making the following assumptions about the business mix:
 For a given customer, Feature1 takes the values 0 and 1 with equal probability.
 For a given customer, independently of Feature1, Feature2 takes the values 0 and
1 with equal probability.
 For a given customer, independently of Feature1, the benefit amount, ‘Benefit’, is
such that its logarithm is Normally distributed with mean 7.5 and standard
deviation 0.5 if Feature2 = 0, and Normally distributed with mean 7 and standard
deviation 0.5 if Feature2 = 1.
 The variable ‘Outcome’ indicates whether full medical underwriting would reveal
issues requiring the proposal to be declined or accepted with a premium loading.
For a given customer, this variable takes the value 0, representing a proposal that
would be accepted at standard premium rates, with probability:
o 0.95 if Feature1 and Feature2 are both 0.
o 0.8 if Feature1 and Feature2 are both 1.
o 0.9 if one of Feature1 and Feature2 is 0 and the other is 1.
Otherwise, this variable takes the value 1, representing a proposal that would be
declined or accepted with a premium loading.
(i) Generate a 100,000 × 5 matrix, A, in which:
 the first, second and fifth columns consist of independent observations
from the uniform distribution on [0,1]. You should set a random number
generator seed of 123 before generating the observations in the first
column.
 the third column consists of independent observations from the lognormal
distribution of Benefit given that Feature2 = 0.
 the fourth column consists of independent observations from the
lognormal distribution of Benefit given that Feature2 = 1.

Use the R function head to display the first six rows of A in your answer
script. [6]
Let Aij denote the (i,j) entry of A.
(ii) Generate a matrix, B, with 100,000 rows and four columns, Feature1,
Feature2, Benefit and Outcome, in which, in the ith row:
 Feature1, Feature2 and Outcome are equal to 0 if Ai1, Ai2 or Ai5,
respectively are less than the appropriate probability, and 1 otherwise.
 Benefit is equal to either Ai3 or Ai4 as appropriate.
Use the R function head to display the first six rows of data in your answer
script. [9]
The Actuary uses a regression tree to split the hypothetical customers in the matrix B
by Feature1 and Benefit, with the view that those customers in nodes with low
probabilities of an adverse outcome under full medical underwriting, would be
eligible for the simplified process. The Actuary uses the following R code to plot the
tree:
tree = rpart(formula = Outcome ~ Feature1 + Benefit,
data = data.frame(B), control = rpart.control(cp = 2e-4,
maxdepth = 2, minbucket = 5000))
rpart.plot(tree)
(iii) Plot the regression tree object, called ‘tree’, using the R code above. [1]
(iv) Comment on the conclusions the Actuary should draw from the regression tree
‘tree’. [5]
The Actuary creates a further regression tree by weighting each customer, i, in the
matrix B as follows:
􀰭
􀰮􁈺􀯪􀰬􀳔􀬾􀯪􀰭􀳔􁈻
𝑤􀯜
where:
 w0i is the probability density from the lognormal distribution for the actual value
of Benefit for the ith customer and Feature2 = 0.
 w1i is the probability density from the lognormal distribution for the actual value
of Benefit for the ith customer and Feature2 = 1.
 wi is the probability density from the lognormal distribution for the actual values
of Benefit and Feature2 for the ith customer.
(v) Explain the rationale for this choice of weights. 
CS2B A2023–8
(vi) Generate a vector, ‘Weight’, containing the weights as defined above. Use the
R function head to display the first six entries of Weight in your answer
script. [5]
The Actuary uses the following R code to plot the revised tree, ‘tree2’:
tree2 = rpart(formula = Outcome ~ Feature1 + Benefit,
data = data.frame(B), weights = Weight,
control = rpart.control(cp = 2e-4, maxdepth = 2,
minbucket = 5000))
rpart.plot(tree2)
(vii) Plot the revised regression tree object, called ‘tree2’, using the R code above.

(viii) Comment on the practical suitability of this method of determining the
eligibility criteria for the simplified underwriting process for this product. [4]
