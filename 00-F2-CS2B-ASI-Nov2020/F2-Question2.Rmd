Exercise 1
==================================================================================
i)
Simulate a time series of length 200 observations in a line chart using the following R
function and comment on stationarity. (Set a seed value of 100)
arima.sim(list(order = c(1,1,1), ar = 0.7, ma = 0.3), n = 200)



---

Exercise 1
==================================================================================
Solution 2:
i)
```{r}
set.seed(100)
observations<-arima.sim(list(order = c(1,1,1), ar = 0.7, ma = 0.3), n = 200)
plot(observations, main = "Line chart of the time series observations")

```

# The data is not stationary as we observe that the values are changing with time
# Upward Trend is observed in the data, which indicates the data being non
stationary
# Mean and Standard Deviation are different at different points in time

---

Exercise 2
==================================================================================
ii) Plot the auto correlation function and partial auto correlation function of the data if (i)
is stationarity, otherwise take the first difference of the observations and plot the above
graphs. Comment on the possible ARMA model based on the graphs. (5)


Exercise 2
==================================================================================
ii)
# As the data is not stationary, we take the first difference of the observations
diff_obs<-diff(observations)
acf(diff_obs)

Page 3 of 11IAI

```{r}

pacf(diff_obs)


```

As both ACF and PACF are seen to have spikes only for the first two lags and they appear to tail off after that,
ARMA(2,2) model appears to be the most appropriate model based on the ACF and PACF plots.


---

Exercise 3
==================================================================================

iii) Fit AR(1), AR(2), MA(1) and ARMA(1,1) models to the observations from (ii) and
comment on the best fitting model using AIC or any other metric. (7)
