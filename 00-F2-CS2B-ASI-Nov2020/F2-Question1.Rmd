Q. 1)
Use the data file “Mortality_Investigation.csv” to answer the below questions. This table
contains the details of mortality investigation performed on 100 different male lives
between 1-Jan-2016 and 31-Dec-2018.

---

Part 1
===========
Print first 6 rows of the data ensuring correct data formats for all the columns and
calculate the proportion of the total sample died, survived and withdrew from the
observation period.

---

Solution 1:
i)
```{r}
Mort_Inv <- read.csv("D: /Mortality_Investigation.csv")
Mort_Inv$DoB<-as.Date(Mort_Inv$DoB)
Mort_Inv$DoJ<-as.Date(Mort_Inv$DoJ)
Mort_Inv$DoE<-as.Date(Mort_Inv$DoE)

```

---


```{r}
head(Mort_Inv) [2]
prop.table(table(Mort_Inv$Exit_Reason)) 

```

Part 2
=====================


ii) Compute two new columns ‘Age_At_Entry’ and ‘Age_At_Exit’ for each person (you
can assume a completed year as 365.25 days and you can compute the age as difference
between the dates in decimals like 35.234 years) and print the last 6 rows of the newly
formed table.

---

ii)
Mort_Inv$Age_At_Entry<-round((Mort_Inv$DoJ-Mort_Inv$DoB)/365.25,4)
Mort_Inv$Age_At_Exit<-round((Mort_Inv$DoE-Mort_Inv$DoB)/365.25,4)

2019-10-04
Survived 37.7413 days 39.2635 days

---

Part 3
=====================
iii) Compute the average age at entry and the average age at exit of the people for whom
“Death” was the reason of Exit. (3)

---

iii)
mean(Mort_Inv$Age_At_Entry[Mort_Inv$Exit_Reason == "Death"])
mean(Mort_Inv$Age_At_Exit[Mort_Inv$Exit_Reason == "Death"])
> mean(Mort_Inv$Age_At_Entry[Mort_Inv$Exit_Reason == "Death"])
Time difference of 37.01715 days
> mean(Mort_Inv$Age_At_Exit[Mort_Inv$Exit_Reason == "Death"])
Time difference of 37.89168 days

Part 4
=====================
If the age label used is “Age last Birthday”, then calculate
iv) Number of lives out of total 100 lives who have contributed the full year towards the
c
central exposed to risk E 37
. (4)
c

---

iv)
sum((Mort_Inv$Age_At_Entry)<37&Mort_Inv$Age_At_Exit>38)
 14
[4]

---


Part 5
=====================
If the age label used is “Age last Birthday”, then calculate
v) Number of lives who did not contribute at all towards the central exposed to risk E 37
. (4)

---


v)
sum((Mort_Inv$Age_At_Entry)>38|Mort_Inv$Age_At_Exit<37)
 49


---

Part 6
=====================
c
vi) Total number of years of contribution to E 37
by all the lives together (Round your
answer to 2 digits after the decimal).

```{r}
Mort_Inv$Contribution37<-ifelse((Mort_Inv$Age_At_Exit<37 |Mort_Inv$Age_At_Entry> 38),"No","Yes" )
Mort_Inv$contribution37_Period<-ifelse(Mort_Inv$Contribution37 == "Yes",
(pmin(38,Mort_Inv$Age_At_Exit)- pmax(37,Mort_Inv$Age_At_Entry)),0)
sum(Mort_Inv$contribution37_Period)
```
