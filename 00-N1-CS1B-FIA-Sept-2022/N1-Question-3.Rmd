3 A male athlete ran 1 mile in 254.4 seconds on 31 May 1913. This was a world record 
at the time. The data file <tt>mile_records.Rdata</tt> contains the dates measured in 
days since 31 May 1913 and the times (in seconds) of all new world records for males 
over the 1-mile distance. The data set <tt>mile_records.Rdata</tt> contains 32 records. 
The variables are called record.date and record.time in the Rdata file. You 
can load the file with load("mile_records.Rdata"). 

---

A. Plot record.time as a function of <tt>record.date</tt>.  

B. Calculate the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the two data sets.  

C. Fit a linear regression model to the data using <tt>record.time</tt> as the response 
variable and record.date as the only explanatory variable. State the 
estimated intercept and slope of the regression line. 



(D.) Plot the regression line by adding it to the plot from part A.

Q3
# load data
load("mile_records.Rdata")
(i)
plot(record.date, record.time, ylab="New World Record Times 
(seconds)", xlab="Days since 31.05.1913",main="Plot for 
mile_records data set") 


(ii)
cor(record.date, record.time) 
-0.9885164 
(iii)
model = lm(record.time ~ record.date) 
coefficients(model) 
The intercept of the regression line is 254.8  
and the slope is -0.001076

(E.) Perform a statistical test in order to test the null hypothesis that the slope of 
the regression line in part D. is zero, against a suitable alternative using the 
output of the fitted model from part C.  
(F.) Comment on the relationship between the two variables.  
For simplicity, you can assume that 1 year has 365 days. 
(G.) Estimate the expected time in seconds of the world record 100 years after the 
most recent record in this data set. 

---

(H.) Calculate the number of years (from the most recent record) in which you 
expect the world record to be 2 minutes, based on your fitted model from 
part (iii).  
(ix) Comment on the suitability of the linear regression model for modelling 
record.time as a function of record.date.

Multiple R-squared: 0.9772, Adjusted R-squared: 0.9764 
F-statistic: 1284 on 1 and 30 DF, p-value: < 2.2e-16
P-value is very small (i.e. p-value: < 2.2e-16) 
So conclude that negative slope is significant

(vi)

* The plot clearly shows a negative relationship between days since May 1913 and the 
current one-mile world record. 

* The correlation coefficient is very close to -1, and the slope is negative and significant, 
confirming the relationship 

* However, the response variable cannot increase with time (it is a world record). 

* So we cannot observe a positive relationship, meaning that the above results are to be 
expected

(vii)
x = record.date[32]+365*100 
predict(model, data.frame(record.date=x)) 
# Or
coefficients(model) + coefficients(model)*x
181.66 seconds 
---
(viii)
twoMinuteDate = (120 -
coefficients(model))/coefficients(model) 
twoMinuteDate = twoMinuteDate - record.date[32] 
twoMinuteDate/365 
This gives: 256.97 years. 
---
(ix)

* The model is suitable for modelling the past observations, and we would also consider 
this a good model for predicting records in the near future as the model is significant, 𝑅𝑅2
is close to one and the correlation is clearly negative. 

* We have no reason to assume that 
the linear relationship will break down in the near future 

* However, in the long run the model predicts unrealistically low times for the one mile run, 
eventually predicting even negative times

The quality of answers given in this question was mixed.
Part (i) was well answered generally, but marks were lost for not providing appropriate 
annotation on the plot. 
In part (v) a number of candidates failed to state the hypotheses and explicitly state a full 
conclusion. 
In parts (vii), (viii), a relatively small proportion of candidates provided fully correct 
answers. In parts (vi) and (ix) credit was awarded for other reasonable comments.
