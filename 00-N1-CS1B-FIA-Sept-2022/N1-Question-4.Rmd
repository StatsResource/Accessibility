CS1B S2022–5 
4 An Analyst is asked to produce a report on the existing imbalance in salary in jobs 
related to Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM). The Analyst 
considers a sample of 100 employees in STEM-related jobs. For each of these 
employees, information is provided on starting and current salary (in units of £5,000), 
gender, type of job and job location, the employee’s age and their relevant experience. 
The data is given in the file named employee.RData. After loading the data into R, 
the data frame data_employee, with its variables listed below, will be available. 
Variable Variable definition 
salary.current Current yearly salary 
salary.start Starting yearly salary 
gender Male = 0, female = 1 
job.type 1 = geneticist, 2 = civil engineer, 3 = statistician, 
4 = biophysicist, 5 = pathologist 
job.location Big city = 0, small city = 1 
age Age in years 
experience Relevant job experience in years

(i) Write down the categorical and the numerical variables in the data.  
(ii) Plot a scatter graph between each pair of the numerical variables using your 
answer to part A.  
(iii) Comment on the relationship between the current salary and the remaining 
numerical variables.  
(iv) (a) Calculate the lower quartile, median, upper quartile and the mean for 
the current yearly salary.  
(b) Test whether the proportion of male employees with current salary 
below 9.86 is significantly different from the proportion of female 
employees with current salary below 9.86. 
[Hint: <tt>salary.current[gender==0]</tt> gives a vector of current salary for 
males.] 

---

(i) **Write down the categorical and the numerical variables in the data.**

The variables in the dataset are:
- `salary.current`: Current yearly salary
- `salary.start`: Starting yearly salary
- `gender`: Male = 0, female = 1
- `job.type`: 1 = geneticist, 2 = civil engineer, 3 = statistician, 4 = biophysicist, 5 = pathologist
- `job.location`: Big city = 0, small city = 1
- `age`: Age in years
- `experience`: Relevant job experience in years

From this list, you need to identify which variables are categorical and which are numerical.

Categorical variables: `gender`, `job.type`, `job.location`
Numerical variables: `salary.current`, `salary.start`, `age`, `experience`


(v) Determine the median, mean and variance of the current yearly salary for each 
of the job types in job.type.  
[Hint: <tt>salary.current[job.type==1]</tt> gives a vector of current 
salary for geneticists.] 
(vi) (a) Test at the 5% level whether the mean starting salary and the mean 
current salary are significantly different. 
(b) Test at the 5% level whether the mean current salary for big-city 
employees is greater than the mean current salary for small-city 
employees.

Q4
# load data
load("employee.RData")
(i)
Categorical variables: gender, job.type and job.location 

Numerical variables: salary.current, salary.start, age and experience 
(ii)
Scattergraphs between each pair of continous variables:
data_continuous <- data.frame(salary.current, salary.start, 
age, experience) 
pairs(data_continuous) 
or 
plot(data_continuous)

---

(iii)
The first column shows the relationship between salary.current and the other continuous 
variables. We can see that:
there appears to be a positive linear relationship between the current and the starting 
salary 
there appears to be a weak negative linear relationship between current salary and the 
employee age and the employee experience 
age has an increasing relationship with salary at the very start but then it becomes 
unclear 


---
The second and third parts of the exercise involve plotting scatter graphs and commenting on the relationships between variables. Let's break them down:

### ii) Plot a scatter graph between each pair of the numerical variables using your answer to part i.

For this part, you need to create scatter plots for each pair of the numerical variables identified in part i. The numerical variables are `salary.current`, `salary.start`, `age`, and `experience`. You can use R to create these scatter plots. Here's an example code snippet to generate the scatter plots:

```r
# Load data
load("employee.RData")

# Create a data frame with numerical variables
data_continuous <- data.frame(salary.current, salary.start, age, experience)

# Generate scatter plot matrix
pairs(data_continuous)
```

This code will create a matrix of scatter plots for all pairs of the numerical variables.

### iii) Comment on the relationship between the current salary and the remaining numerical variables.

For this part, you need to analyze the scatter plots generated in part ii and comment on the relationships observed between `salary.current` and the other numerical variables (`salary.start`, `age`, and `experience`). 

Here's an example of how you might comment on the relationships:

- **Relationship between `salary.current` and `salary.start`**: There appears to be a positive linear relationship between the current salary and the starting salary. This indicates that employees who started with higher salaries tend to have higher current salaries.
- **Relationship between `salary.current` and `age`**: There might be a weak negative linear relationship between the current salary and age, suggesting that younger employees might have slightly higher current salaries. However, this relationship might not be very strong.
- **Relationship between `salary.current` and `experience`**: There appears to be a weak negative linear relationship between the current salary and experience. This might suggest that employees with more experience do not necessarily have higher current salaries, or the relationship could be more complex.

Feel free to elaborate on these comments based on your observations from the scatter plots. If you need further assistance with the remaining parts of the exercise, let me know!

(iv)(a) 
The lower quartile, median, upper quartile of salary.current are given as:
quantile(salary.current, c(0.25,0.5,0.75)) 
25% 50% 75% 
9.1750 9.3650 9.8625 
and the mean:
 
mean(salary.current) 
# 9.4778
## Alternatively, candidates can use the function summary
summary(salary.current)
Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max.
8.780 9.175 9.365 9.478 9.863 10.630


---


(b) 
We use the following notation:
p1: proportion of male employees with current salary values below 9.86 
p2: proportion of female employees with values below 9.86
𝐻𝐻0: p1 = p2
𝐻𝐻1: p1 ≠ p2 
Proportion calculations:
Current salary for male employees:
cmale<- salary.current[gender==0] 
Those less than the upper quartile:
qmale<- cmale[cmale <9.86] 
Number of male employees with current salary lower than the upper quartile:
x1<- length(qmale) ; x1 
# 26
Number of male employees:
n1<- length(cmale); n1 
# 51
Current salary for female employees:
cfemale<- salary.current[gender==1] 
Those less than the upper quartile:
qfemale<- cfemale[cfemale <9.86] 
---

Number of female employees with current salary lower than the upper quartile:
x2<- length(qfemale) ; x2 
# 48
Number of female employees:
n2<- length(cfemale); n2 
# 49

---

Perform test:
```{r}
prop.test(c(x1,x2), c(n1 , n2 ), alternative = "two.sided" )

```
2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction
data: c(x1, x2) out of c(n1, n2)
X-squared = 26.276, df = 1, p-value = 2.959e-07
alternative hypothesis: two.sided
95 percent confidence interval:
-0.6325920 -0.3069838
sample estimates:
prop 1 prop 2 
0.5098039 0.9795918

---

### Conclusion

* The p-value is less than 0.05, therefore reject 𝐻𝐻0. 
* The proportion of males with current
salary below 9.86 is significantly different from the proportion of female employees with 
current salary below 9.86

(v)
The median, mean and variances of salary.current for each of the job type in job.type can
be given as follows:
```{r}
Median<- rep(0,5)
Mean<- rep(0,5)
Var<- rep(0,5
for(i in 1:5){
Median[i]<- median(salary.current[job.type==i] )
Mean[i]<- mean(salary.current[job.type ==i] )
Var[i]<- var(salary.current[job.type ==i] )
} 
```
## Median
# 9.180 9.285 9.410 10.160 10.030 
## Mean
# 9.168571 9.280333 9.440000 10.101333 10.119167 
## Var
# 0.07471261 0.02906540 0.00320000 0.03128381 0.05988106

(vi) (a) 

𝐻𝐻0: Mean starting salaries and the current salaries are equal
𝐻𝐻1: Mean starting salaries and the current salaries are not equal. 

```{r}
t.test(salary.start,salary.current, paired = TRUE) 
```

#Results 
Paired t-test
data: salary.start and salary.current
t = -38.506, df = 99, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
-0.7190359 -0.6485641
sample estimates:
mean of the differences 
-0.6838
The p-value is less than 0.05; therefore we reject 𝐻𝐻0 and conclude that the current salary
is significantly different from the starting salary 
---
(b) 
We define two vectors of current salaries for big- and small-city employees:
salary.current_bcity<- salary.current[job.location==0]
salary.current_scity <- salary.current[job.location==1] 
𝐻𝐻0: Mean starting salaries for big and small city employees are equal
𝐻𝐻1: Mean starting salaries for big city employee > small city employee 

```{r}
t.test(salary.current_bcity, salary.current_scity,alternative= 
"greater") 

```
# Results 
Welch Two Sample t-test
data: salary.current_bcity and salary.current_scity
t = 5.2366, df = 90.239, p-value = 5.303e-07
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is greater than 0
95 percent confidence interval:
0.2481034 Inf
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
9.572297 9.208846


---


We obtain a p-value<0.05, and therefore reject 𝐻𝐻0 at 5%. We conclude that the current
salary for big-city employees is greater than that for small-city employees

This question was answered well in general.
The computations in parts (iv) and (v) can be performed in a number of alternative ways 
in R, and credit was given as appropriate when alternative R code was presented. 
Many candidates failed to provide a fully correct answer in part (iv)(b), where a number 
of errors were found in the calculations.
In parts (vi)(a), (vi)(b) a number of candidates failed to state the hypotheses of the tests 
and complete conclusions.
