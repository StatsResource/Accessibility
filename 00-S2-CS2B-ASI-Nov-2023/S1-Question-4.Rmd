Q. 4)
A bank in the country Actuaria is recruiting employees for different sections. Initially, it is compulsory to work for Marketing section for one year. After working for one year, they can either move to Administration or Training sections. On exactly April 1st they have the choice of moving to any other sections. Probability of moving from one section to another is dependent on the age last birthday.
From the historical data it is evident that the transition probability of a person aged ‘x’ last birthday on April 1st is as per the following table:
Marketing
Administration
Training
Marketing
1- 0.0025*x-0.0075*x
0.0025*x
0.0075*x
Administration
0.003*x
1- 0.003*x - 0.004*x
0.004*x
Training
0.001*x
0.003*x
1- 0.001*x - 0.003*x
i) Create a vector with the state space of the Markov Chain using R Code. You should paste the results in your answer.
(1)
ii) Consider two persons aged 30 last birthday and aged 40 last birthday respectively who are currently in marketing section. Construct transition matrices of the section change probabilities. You should paste the results to your answer.
(3)
iii) Create a Markov Chain objects with the state space equal to your vector in part (i) and transition matrices from part (ii). You should paste the results to your answer.
(R package for Markov Chains may be loaded and used for the same).
(3)
iv) Calculate the probability of transition for the following employees who are currently in Marketing section:
a) an employee with age 30 last birthday moving into Training section in three years.
b) an employee with age 40 last birthday moving into Training section in five years.

v) Plot the transition probability matrices in part (iv) for age 40 years.
(1)
vi) Set a seed of 250. Simulate sequences of 250 states using markovchainSequence function for both persons in part (ii). Compute the frequency of the states.
(3)
vii) Use a bar chart to plot the relative frequency of the states (for age 30) and label the chart appropriately.

iv) a) > n<-30 > B<-c(1,0,0) > for(i in 1:3){B=B%*%EmploymentTransition(n+i-1)} > B [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] 0.3625932 0.1791008 0.458306
So the required probability in 3 years is 45.8306%
b) > n<-40 > B<-c(1,0,0) > for(i in 1:5){B=B%*%EmploymentTransition(n+i-1)} > B
[,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,] 0.1681993 0.2658399 0.5659607
So the required probability in 5 years is 56.59607%.
