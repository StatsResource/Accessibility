%\subsection{More Definitions}
To understand a diagnostic plot called the residual-leverage plot, we must understand three things:


*   Leverage,
*   Standardized residuals, and
*   Cook's distance.

% Standardization

% Cook's Distance
%\subsubsection{Cook's Distance}
%One way to think about whether or not the results you have were driven by a given data point is to calculate how far the predicted values for your data would move if your model were fit without the data point in question. 

%This calculated total distance is called \textbf{Cook's distance}. Fortunately, you don't have to rerun your regression model N times to find out how far the predicted values will move, Cook's D is a function of the leverage and standardized residual associated with each data point.

\subsection*{Example}

Consider the plots associated with four different situations:

*   a dataset where everything is fine
*   a dataset with a high-leverage, but low-standardized residual point
*   a dataset with a low-leverage, but high-standardized residual point
*   a dataset with a high-leverage, high-standardized residual point
\end{enumerate}

* The plots on the left show the data, the center of the data  with a blue dot, the underlying data generating process with a dashed gray line, the model fit with a blue line, and the special point with a red dot. 
* On the right are the corresponding residual-leverage plots; the special point is 21. 
* The model is badly distorted primarily in the fourth case where there is a point with high leverage and a large (negative) standardized residual.

For reference, here are the values associated with the special points:
