Residual Plot
==========================================

The residual data of the simple linear regression model is the difference between the observed data of the dependent variable y and the fitted values $\hat{y}$.
 

#### Problem
 
Plot the residual of the simple linear regression model of the data set faithful against the independent variable waiting.
 


#### Solution
 
We apply the lm function to a formula that describes the variable eruptions by the variable waiting, and save the linear regression model in a new variable eruption.lm. Then we compute the residual with the ``resid`` function.

 

```{r}
eruption.lm = lm(eruptions ~ waiting, data=faithful) 
eruption.res = resid(eruption.lm) 
```


We now plot the residual against the observed values of the variable waiting. 

```{r}

plot(faithful$waiting, eruption.res, 
     ylab="Residuals", xlab="Waiting Time", 
     main="Old Faithful Eruptions") 
 abline(0, 0)                  # the horizon 
```
