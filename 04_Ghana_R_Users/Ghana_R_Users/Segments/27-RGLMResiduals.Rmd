Pearson Residuals





The Pearson residual is the raw residual divided by the square root of the variance function $V(\mu).$
The Pearson residual is the individual contribution to the Pearson $\chi^2$ statistic. 

For a binomial distribution with mi trials in the ith observation, it is defined as

\[ r_{Pi} = \sqrt{ m_{i}}
 \frac{r_{i}}{\sqrt{V(\hat{ \mu_{i}})}} \]
For other distributions, the Pearson residual is defined as

\[ r_{Pi} = \frac{r_{i}}{\sqrt{V(\hat{ \mu_{i}})}}\]
The Pearson residuals can be used to check the model fit at each observation for generalized linear models. 
%These residuals are stored in variables named RP_yname for each response variable, where yname is the response variable name. 
The standardized and studentized Pearson residuals are
\[
r_{Psi} = \frac{r_{Pi}}{\sqrt{\hat{ \phi} (1- h_{i})} } \]
\[ r_{Pti} = \frac{r_{Pi}}{\sqrt{ \hat{ \phi}_{(i)}
 (1- h_{i})} } \]



The \textbf{deviance residual} is the measure of deviance contributed from each observation and is given by
\[r_{Di} = \textrm{sign}( r_{i})
 \sqrt{ d_{i}}\]
where $d_i$ is the individual deviance contribution.
The deviance residuals can be used to check the model fit at each observation for generalized linear models. 

%These residuals are stored in variables named \textit{RD\_yname} for each response variable, where yname is the response variable name. 

The standardized and studentized deviance residuals are
\[
r_{Dsi} = \frac{r_{Di}}{\sqrt{\hat{ \phi} (1- h_{i})} }\]
\[r_{Dti} = \frac{r_{Di}}{\sqrt{ \hat{ \phi}_{(i)}
 (1- h_{i})}}\]
