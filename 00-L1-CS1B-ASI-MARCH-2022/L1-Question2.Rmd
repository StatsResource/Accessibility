Q. 2) Policy and claims information (PolicyData.csv) of 650 policies is provided to you. The 
data contains following fields:
Policy : Policy Number
Claim : Number of claims corresponding to each policy
Cust_Exp: Policyholder’s experience (VS = Very satisfied, SA= Satisfied, DS= 
Disappointed, VD= Very Disappointed) at the end of the policy tenure.
Amount: Claim amount per policy. Note that amount is set 0 if there is no claim.
i) Create a frequency table of claim and share how many policies don’t have any claim. (2)
ii) Plot a histogram of claim count and suggest 2 distributions that can be a good fit. (2)
iii) Given that claim count follows Poisson distribution with following two possible values 
for Poisson parameter:
a) 0.35 and 
b) 0.30

Compute confidence interval at 95% confidence level to assess which value is more 
suitable for the given data. (3)
iv) Compute mean, variance and median of log of claim amount. (Name it: log amount). 
Make sure to exclude policies with no claim. (4)
v) Obtain histogram and Normal QQ Plot of log amount. Add a line to the QQ plot for 
normal distribution (3)
vi) Indicate which distribution the claim amount might be following using evidence from 
(iv) and (v). (3)
vii)Assuming the log amount (i.e. log of claim amount) follows a Normal distribution, test 
if mean of log amount is greater than 10 at 90% level of confidence. State the 
hypothesis and conclusion clearly. (4)
viii) Assess whether the policyholder experience (i.e. Cust_Exp) changes with more 
number of claims. Create contingency table and perform test to check the above 
assertion. State the hypothesis clearly. (3)
ix) Please explain why warning message appears while performing the above test. (1)
x) Again, perform the above test by combining 
a. Very Satisfied and Satisfied customers
b. Disappointed and very disappointed customers
and 
c. 2 or more claims. 
Please provide your conclusion on association of policyholder’s experience with 
number of claims. (5)
xi) Amount is defined to be large if the amount is greater than 100,000. Calculate 95% 
confidence interval for proportion of large claim, and comment on the likelihood if 
more than 25% of claims are large. (5)
