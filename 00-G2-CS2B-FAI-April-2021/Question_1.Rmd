1 Before answering this question, the R package for Markov chains should be loaded 
into R using the following code: 
install.packages("markovchain") 
library(markovchain)
Xt is a Markov chain on the state space {1,2,3} with the following transition matrix: 
൭
p 1 – p 0
q 0 1 – q
0 r 1 – r
൱
where 0 < p, q, r < 1. 
(i) Construct an R function, with arguments p, q and r, that generates a Markov 
chain object for Xt. [5] 
 Assume that p = 0.75 and r = 0.25. 
(ii) Construct R code that calculates the stationary distribution of Xt for values of 
q from 0.1 to 0.9 inclusive, at intervals of 0.1, pasting your results into your 
answer script. [7] 
(iii) Plot a graph showing the stationary distributions of Xt calculated in part (ii) as 
a function of q. You should include three separately coloured lines on your 
graph, each line representing the stationary probabilities of each state. [8]

Part (i) was very well answered although some candidates lost marks for not creating 
a function, or for creating a function outputting a matrix rather than a Markov chain 
object. Candidates who did not create a function or who created a function outputting 
a matrix rather than a Markov chain object needed to perform additional work in part 
(ii). 
Part (ii) was well answered. Candidates who were less familiar with loops in R 
included more extensive R code than necessary. Candidates who answered part (ii) by 
raising the transition matrices to a large power were required to raise the matrices to 
a second large power to demonstrate convergence otherwise only partial credit was 
awarded.
Part (iii) was poorly answered. Many candidates lost marks for missing or 
inappropriate titles, axis labels and/or legends. Where candidates were unfamiliar 
with the legend function in R, a manually applied legend was accepted provided that it 
correctly represented the line colours and was situated next to the chart.
