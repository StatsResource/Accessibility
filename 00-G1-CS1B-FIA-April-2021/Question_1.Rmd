1 A researcher records the levels of caffeine present in their bloodstream at various time 
intervals after drinking a cup of coffee. 
T: Time elapsed 
(30-minute 
intervals) 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
C: Caffeine in 
blood 
(milligrams) 
52.2 39.3 28.3 19.03 13.96 11.46 8.78 6.55 5.43 5.03 
 
You can enter the values, for T (time) and C (caffeine), into R using: 
```{r}
time = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) 
caffeine = c(52.2,39.3,28.3,19.03,13.96,11.46,8.78,6.55,5.43,5.03)
```

Part 1
============================
(i) Plot a scatterplot of the data. 


---

Part 2
============================
(ii) Comment on the relationship between C and T based on the plot in part 1.  

Part 3
============================
(iii) Justify why a logarithmic transformation of C is appropriate. 

Part 4
============================
(iv) Perform the transformation suggested in part 3.  

Part 5
============================
(a) Plot a scatterplot of the transformed data. 
(b) Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient for the transformed data. 
(c) Comment on the scatterplot and Pearson correlation coefficient 
produced in parts (v)(a) and (v)(b).
