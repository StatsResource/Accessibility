***CS2B ‚Äì Risk Modelling and Survival Analysis ***


* The emphasis is placed on being able to apply statistical methods to actuarial problems using real data sets and the open-source software environment R. 

* Time Series. Probability Distributions, Survival Analysis

3 A study was carried out to estimate the proportion, ùëù, of workers that commute by 
train to work. A total of n ‡µå 200 workers were sampled at random and were asked the 
question: ‚ÄòDo you take the train to work?‚Äô 

* The workers‚Äô answers were recorded as a 
binary outcome, yi, for worker i, with 1 for yes and 0 for no. The data are available in 
the file BinaryTrain.RData.

---

Two commuters, Alice and Norman, were interested in the study and proposed 
different prior distributions for the proportion p. 
<p>

Alice assumed a discrete prior distribution g(p) given in the following table: 

p 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 
g(p) 0.5 0.2 0.2 0.05 0.05 
Norman chose to use a beta prior distribution for $p$ , with parameters 3 and 12. 

---

### Exercise  1

(i) (a) Calculate the mean and the standard deviation for Alice‚Äôs prior
distribution. 
(b) Generate 10,000 random values from Norman‚Äôs prior distribution.
(c) Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the values generated in
part (i)(b).  
(d) Comment on whether or not Alice and Norman have similar prior 
beliefs for p. 

---


Norman‚Äôs beta prior distribution for p is adopted for the remainder of the question. 


* The likelihood of the model in the study is given by: 
L·à∫p·àª ‚àù p\sum yi ·à∫1 ‚Äì p·àªn ‚Äì \sum yi . 
* The posterior density of $p$ is given by: 
f(p|y) ‚àù p2 + \sum yi·à∫1 ‚Äì p·àª11 + n ‚Äì \sumyi ,
where \sum yi is the total sum of all the binary data.

Q3
(i)(a)
```{r}
p = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) 
gp=c(0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.05, 0.05) 
mean_A=sum(p*gp)
mean_A
```

```{r}
sd_A = sqrt(sum(gp*p^2)-mean_A^2)

sd_N
```

(d)
The first and second moments of the two priors are very similar
The two prior beliefs are similar despite one being based on a continuous distribution and the 
other on a discrete distribution 
---

### Exercise  2
(ii) Plot the shape of the posterior density of $p$  without identifying it.  

---

(ii)
Read the data in: 
```{r}
load("BinaryTrain.RData")

 
p = seq(0, 1, by = 0.01)
dens = p^(2+sum(y))*(1-p)^(11+length(y)-sum(y))
plot(p, dens, type = "l", ylab ="",xlab="p") 
```


---

```{r}
curve(x^(2+sum(y))*(1-x)^(11+length(y)-sum(y))) 
```
---

### Exercise  3

Plot the density of Norman‚Äôs prior distribution by setting `ylim = c(0,14)`. 

The posterior distribution of $p$ is beta with parameters 3 + \sum yi and 12 + n ‚Äì \sum yi
. 
---

(iii)
Prior distribution
```{r}
plot(p, dbeta(p, 3, 12), type = "l", ylim =c(0, 14), ylab ="")

```

---

Or,

```{r}
curve(dbeta(x, 3, 12), type="l",
ylim=c(0, 14), ylab ="", xlab="p")
```

---

### Exercise  4

(iv) (a) Plot the posterior density of $p$ by adding it to the plot in part (iii). 
(b) Compare the two densities using your answer in part (iv)(a). 
(c) Comment on the extent to which the posterior distribution is affected 
by the prior distribution. 

---

### Exercise  5

(v) Determine a 90% interval estimate for p based on its posterior distribution. 


---

---

### Exercise 6

(vi) Determine the exact posterior probability that p exceeds 0.25. 
(vii) (a) Generate 10,000 samples from the posterior distribution of p. 
(b) Calculate the proportion of sampled values of $p$ that exceed 0.25. 
(c) Compare your answer in part (vii)(b) with your answer in part (vi).

p = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) 
gp=c(0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.05, 0.05) 
mean_A=sum(p*gp)
mean_A
# 0.195 
>sd_A = sqrt(sum(gp*p^2)-mean_A^2)

mean_N
# 0.2012128 
sd_N = sd(samples_beta)
sd_N
# 0.09913621 
(d)
The first and second moments of the two priors are very similar 
The two prior beliefs are similar despite one being based on a continuous distribution and the other on a discrete distribution 

---

(ii)
Read the data in:
load("BinaryTrain.RData")
p = seq(0, 1, by = 0.01)
dens = p^(2+sum(y))*(1-p)^(11+length(y)-sum(y))
plot(p, dens, type = "l", ylab ="",xlab="p") [3]
Or,
curve(x^(2+sum(y))*(1-x)^(11+length(y)-sum(y)))
Parts (i)-(iii) were generally well answered. Plots in part (i) were varied, with a number of candidates not using reasonable axis labels (or no axis at all), while comments were often missing in (i)(b). A common error in part (ii) was to omit the PAIRED = TRUE parameter, as the question requested. Answers in (iv), (v) were mixed with a range of comments.

x = p
curve(dbeta(x, 3+sum(y), 12+length(y)-sum(y)), type = "l", add=TRUE, col="red")

Or,
>lines(p, dbeta(p,3+sum(y),12+length(y)-sum(y)),col="red")

(b)
Clearly, the posterior is much narrower than the prior. 
(c)
The posterior distribution is more affected by the data than by the prior.

qbeta(c(0.05, 0.95), 3+sum(y), 12+length(y)-sum(y)) 
# 0.1910197 0.2861843
90% interval for p is (0.191, 0.286). 
(vi)
1 - pbeta(0.25, 3+sum(y), 12+length(y)-sum(y)) 
# 0.3216195

A number of candidates did not attempt this question, or only attempted part (i).
For candidates that attempted it, the overall performance was mixed. In part (iii) many candidates plotted the graphs using the simulated values from part (i)(b) or using inappropriate plots, which led to difficulty later in the question.
