Q. 3) The number of customers arriving to a grocery store can be modelled by a Poisson process 
with rate of 30 customers per hour.
1.  Find the probability that there are 2 customers between 10:00 AM and 10:15 AM. (2)
2.  Find the probability that there are 7 customers between 11:00 AM and 11:20 AM
and 15 customers between 11:20 AM and 12 noon. (4)
3.   Prepare a probability distribution table for different number of customers (0, 1, 2…20) at 
any given 10 minute time interval. (5)
