Q. 5) i) Write a general function to compute the truncated moments for a lognormal distribution 
using k, σ, µ, L (the lower bound) and U (the upper bound)
 Given
σ= 0.7
µ = 1.2
L = 10
U = ∞
ii) Use the function generated in (i) to compute the first and second order truncated moments.
iii) Using the function in (i) or otherwise, compute the first two moments for a non-truncated 
normal distribution with the same µ and σ.
iv) Compare the results generated in (ii) and (iii) with appropriate reasoning.
