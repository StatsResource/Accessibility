Q. 5) 1.  Write a general function to compute the truncated moments for a lognormal distribution 
using k, σ, µ, L (the lower bound) and U (the upper bound)
 Given
σ= 0.7
µ = 1.2
L = 10
U = ∞
2.  Use the function generated in (1.  to compute the first and second order truncated moments.
3.   Using the function in (1.  or otherwise, compute the first two moments for a non-truncated 
normal distribution with the same µ and σ.
4.  Compare the results generated in (2.  and (3.   with appropriate reasoning.
