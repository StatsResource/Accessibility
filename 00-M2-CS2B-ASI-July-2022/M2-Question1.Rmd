Q. 1) Given below is the PDF h(x) derived from the CDF H(x) of a GEV distribution
CDF:
PDF:
Based on the historical data, the maxima value for three years are 8, 8 and 9 units
i) Write a function in R to compute the log-likelihood of the above distribution.
ii) Use the function in (i), to find the Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) of the three 
parameters α, \beta and γ. You can use α = 6, \beta = 4 and γ = 5 as the initial estimates of the 
parameters. 
---
iii) Using the MLE parameters obtained in (ii) above, estimate the probability that maximum 
claim ‘p’ in any given year is greater than X where X = {10, 15, 20,….100}. (6)
iv) Plot a curve of the probabilities against the maximum claim in a year and do appropriate 
labelling. (4)
v) Explain the reason associated with the shape of the curve generated in (iv).
