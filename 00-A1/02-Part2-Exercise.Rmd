Consider the n = 30 independent and identically distributed observations
$( y_1 , y_2 , \ldots, y_n )$ given below from a random variable Y with probability distribution
\[\theta y e –\theta
function f ( y, \theta) =
.
y! \]


You can enter the y values into R by using:


---

```{r}

y = c(5,5,6,2,4,10,2,5,5,2,5,3,7,     
      4,4,5,4,6,7,2,8,4,6,4,3,6,
      6,6,5,7)

```

By assuming a prior distribution proportional to $e^{–a\theta}$ , we can show that the posterior
distribution of $\theta$ is:
\[
\sum^{n}_{i=1}y
f (\theta | y 1 , y 2 ,..., y n ) \propto \theta i=1 i e –(n + \alpha) \theta
\]
We can observe that the posterior distribution of $\theta$ is Gamma with parameters
n
∑ i=1 y i – 1 and n + a.

Plot the posterior probability density function of $\theta$ for values of $\theta$ in
the interval [3.2, 6.8] and assuming a = 0.01.
		
[Hint: the range of values of $\theta$ can be obtained in R by
seq(3.2, 6.8, by = 0.01).]
(b)
Carry out a simulation of N = 5,000 posterior samples for the
parameter $\theta$.

(i) (a)

### Exercise 2


Plot the histogram of the posterior distribution of $\theta$.






```{r}
y = c (5, 5, 6, 2, 4, 10, 2, 5, 5, 2, 5, 3, 7, 4, 4, 5, 4, 6,
7, 2, 8, 4, 6, 4, 3, 6, 6, 6, 5, 7)

## plot the posterior pdf of theta
theta = seq(3.2, 6.8, by = 0.01)
```


---


```{r}
plot(theta, dgamma(theta, sum(y)-1, length(y) + 0.01), 
     ylab = "Density", type = "l")
```

---



The posterior samples are
```{r}
x = rgamma(5000, sum(y)-1, 30 + 0.01)
```

```{r}
head(x)
```

---

#### Exercise 2

We can plot the histogram using




```{r eval=FALSE}
x = rgamma(5000, sum(y)-1, 30 + 0.01)

hist(x, 
     main="Posterior distribution of theta",
     xlab="theta")
```


---


```{r echo=FALSE}
x = rgamma(5000, sum(y)-1, 30 + 0.01)
hist(x, 
     main="Posterior distribution of theta",
     xlab="theta")
```


---


### Exercise 3

Calculate the mean, median and standard deviation of the posterior distribution
of $\theta$.

```{r}
mean(x)
# 5.003996 

median(x)
# 4.997373

sd(x)
# 0.4117624 
```

---

* Two possible values for the true value of parameter $\theta$ are $\theta$ =15 and $\theta$ = 5.


* 15 is quite far away from the range of samples obtained for the posterior distribution
of $\theta$.

* On the other hand 5 is more likely to be the true value.


---

### Exercise 5


Comment on these two values based on the posterior distribution of $\theta$ plotted
in part (ii) and summarised in part (iii).



* 15 is very unlikely to be the case if there is no calculation error.

* 5 fits well within the distribution and the values of the mean and the median are very close to it.
