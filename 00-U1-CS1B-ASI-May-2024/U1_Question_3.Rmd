Q. 3)
Consider a portfolio of fire insurance policies. The data relating to 192 policies which have claimed at least once till now, is given in the file Firepolicies.csv. Confirm through output that the file contains data regarding four variables:
•
Occupancy:
The claim has arisen in five different Occupancies:
TM – for Textile Mills
DW – for Dwellings
TG – for Transporters’ Godowns
CS – for Cold Storage Premises
HG – for Hazardous Goods Storage
•
Location:
It relates to the loss state:
M – for Maharashtra
G – for Gujarat
T – for Telangana
K – for Karnataka
A – for Andhra Pradesh
•
Claim.size:
It refers to the amount of the claim in INR lakhs.
•
Claimed:
This is an indicator variable which captures whether there is an incidence of claim in the past one year.
0 – refers to NO claim in the past one year
1 – refers to ONE claim in the past one year
i)
View the data Firepolicies.csv for 192 entries using read.csv function. Columns Claim.Size, and Claimed have numeric data type, all other columns i.e. Location and Occupancy have character data type.
(1)
ii)
Using the Firepolicies.csv, calculate the proportion of:

---
a)
Policyholders with no claims in the past one year from the state of Maharahstra
b)
Policyholders with no claims in the past one year from the state of Gujarat
(3)
(1)
iii)
Test the hypothesis that the proportion of policyholders with no claims in the past one year is equal in both states (Maharashtra and Gujarat) at 5% level of significance. You should state the null and alternate hypotheses, report the p-value of the test and arrive at a clear conclusion.
(5)
iv)
Test the hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the average claim size for Textile Mills and Transporters’ Godowns at 5% level of significance. You should state the null and alternate hypotheses, report the p-value of the test and arrive at a clear conclusion. Assume that population variances are equal.

---
v)
The number of policies with at least one claim (X) for the fire insurance portfolio is modelled as a random variable with a Binomial distribution X ~ Binomial (n, p).
An Actuary wishes to fit different Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to the data, assuming that the number of policies with one submitted claim has a Binomial distribution and the link function of the GLM is the logit function.
a)
Fit a GLM to the data such that p depends on the Location and Claim Size i.e., Loss State and the Claim size and report the summary.
b)
Fit a GLM to the data such that p depends on the Occupancy and Claim Size and report the summary.
(4)
(2)
vi)
Compare the fit of the models in parts (v)(a) and (v)(b) using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) and comment on which model is preferable.
(3)
vii)
Among the four variables as given in the Firepolicies.csv data, which of them are numerical variables and which of them are factor variables? What is the difference between the two in the context of generalised linear models?

Solution 3:

 (1)
(ii) 
a) 
> Maha<-Firepolicies[Firepolicies$Location=="M",]
> Maha_0_Claims<-Maha[Maha$Claimed == 0,]
> ProporMaha_0_Claims<-nrow(Maha_0_Claims)/nrow(Maha)
> ProporMaha_0_Claims
[1] 0.7346939
(3)
b) 
> Gujarat<-Firepolicies[Firepolicies$Location=="G",]
> Gujarat_0_Claims<-Gujarat[Gujarat$Claimed == 0,]
> ProporGuj_0_claims <-nrow(Gujarat_0_Claims)/nrow(Gujarat)
> ProporGuj_0_claims
[1] 0.5909091

(iii) 
𝐻0(Null Hypothesis):


---
Proportion of No claims in the past one year in Maharashtra is equal to Propo
rtion of NO Claims in the past one year in Gujarat
𝐻1(Alternative Hypothesis):
Proportion of No claims in the past one year in Maharashtra is NOT equal to Pr
oportion of NO Claims in the past one year in Gujarat
(1)
> prop.test (c(nrow( Maha_0_Claims),nrow(Gujarat_0_Claims)),c(nrow(Maha),nrow
(Gujarat)),correct = FALSE)
(1)
2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction
data: c(nrow(Maha_0_Claims), nrow(Gujarat_0_Claims)) out of c(nrow(Maha), nr
ow(Gujarat))
X-squared = 2.1568, df = 1, p-value = 0.1419
alternative hypothesis: two. sided
95 percent confidence interval:
-0.04696637 0.33453595
sample estimates:
 prop 1 prop 2
0.7346939 0.5909091 
 (1)
p-value is 0.1419 (1)
At 95% confidence interval (-0.04696637, 0.33453595), which contains “0”, we h
ave insufficient evidence to reject null hypothesis and can conclude that ther
e is no significant difference between Maharashtra and Gujarat in respect of t
he proportion of No claims in the previous year. (1) 
 (5) 
(iv) 
𝐻0(Null Hypothesis):
Population mean of Textile Mills Claims is equal to Population mean of Transp
orters’ Godowns Claims
𝐻1(Alternative Hypothesis):
Population mean of Textile Mills Claims is NOT equal to Population mean of Tra
nsporters’ Godowns Claims

(1)
Two Sample t-test
data: Textile$Claim.Size and Transporter$Claim.Size
t = 7.877, df = 103, p-value = 3.586e-12
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:

Page 8 of 11
24.27889 40.61871
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y
98.07843 65.62963 
(1)
p-value is 3.586e-12 (1)
At 95% Confidence interval as the confidence interval (24.27889 40.618
71) does not contain the value 0, we have sufficient evidence to reject Null H
ypothesis and conclude that there is significant difference between the averag
e claim size of Textile Mills and Transporters’ Godowns.

(vi) 
AIC for Model 1 = 259.65 and AIC for Model 2 = 259.28 (1)
The AIC is smaller for the model2 as compared to model1 (1)
So Claim Size and Occupancy model2 seems to be a better predictor than
 Claim Size and Location, and we would choose the model2. (1)
Alternatively,
Since both the models have a very minor difference in AICs, one can conclude
that both models 1 and 2 are equally good.
(3) 
(vii) 
Claimed is a numerical variable
Claim.Size is a numerical variable
Location is a factor variable
Occupancy is a factor variable

Page 10 of 11
Numerical variables are continuous variables which can take numerical values.
Claim size and Claimed (0 for no claims in the last year or 1 for claim in t
he last year) are examples in the context of this GLM.
(2)
Factor / categorical variables are variables which only take categories.
Location is a factor variable which takes values of 5 states – M, G, T, K and
A. Occupancy is also a factor variable which takes 5 values viz.TM, TG, DW,
CS and HG.
