3 An insurance company is looking to launch an investigation into the mortality patterns
of a group of pensioners aged from 55 to 90. The data is contained in the file called
‘CS2B_S23_Q3_Pensioners.csv’.
(i) Construct R code to load the dataset into R, assign it to a dataframe called
‘dataset1’, and display the last eight rows. [2]
Mortality rates are calculated as the ratio of ‘DeathCount’ by ‘PopulationSize’.
(ii) Construct R code to add a new column called ‘logRate’ containing the
logarithm of the mortality rates, to the dataframe dataset1. 
The company would like to use this data to estimate mortality rates beyond age 90.
They decide to start with a simple model of the form:
𝑙𝑞􀯫 􀵌 α 􀵅 β𝑥 􀵅 ε􀯫
where 𝑙𝑞􀯫 is the logarithm of mortality rate at age x, α and β are the intercept and
slope parameters, respectively and ε􀯫 indicates the error term.
The Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) is given by:
RSS 􀵌 Σ􀬽􀬴 􁈺logRate 􀵆 α 􀵆 β𝑥􁈻􀬶
􀯫􀭀􀬹􀬹
(iii) Construct R code to determine, to five decimal places, the estimate of the
intercept and slope parameters that minimises the RSS. [3]
(iv) Plot the fitted model together with the logarithm of the observed mortality
rates as a function of age on the same graph. 
(v) Comment on the plot in (iv) above. 
The company would like to look at ways to improve the model and decides to
investigate the following family of five models with polynomial terms in age x:
𝑙𝑞􀯫 􀵌 􀷍 α􀯞𝑥􀯞
􀯣
􀯞􀭀􀬴
􀵅 ε􀯫
for p = 1,2,3,4,5 and where α􀯞 are parameters to be estimated.
(vi) Construct R code to fit these five models to the data and store the
corresponding RSS into a dataframe called ‘output_rss’ such that the first
column of output_rss contains the values of p and the second column
contains the values of the RSS. [8]
(vii) State which is the best model (among the five models) according to RSS. 
CS2B S2023–5
(viii) Construct R code that uses the best model to forecast the logarithm of the
mortality rates from age 91 to 110 and print your forecast values. [7]
(ix) Comment on this forecast and the appropriateness of using RSS for model
selection. [2]

Comment on this graph:
Mortality rate increases exponentially with age 
Log mortality rates increase linearly with age 
There is greater variation at the youngest ages 
The model seems to fit the data well overall 
but there is some systematic bias for higher ages 
mortality is underestimated above age 80 
there may not be one linear model suitable for the full age range

(ix)
This model fits the data better compared to M_1 
However, RSS has selected the most complex model among the five 
Because RSS does not have a penalty terms against model complexity 
The forecast trend is counter-intuitive 
Because the risk of dying increases as people age 
Using a penalise criteria such as AIC will probably lead to better result 
higher order polynomial are often unstable and unsuitable for forecasting 
this might be an example of model over-fitting
