***CS2B – Risk Modelling and Survival Analysis ***


* The emphasis is placed on being able to apply statistical methods to actuarial problems using real data sets and the open-source software environment R. 

* Time Series. Probability Distributions, Survival Analysis

1 The data files ‘CS2B_S23_Q1_Deaths.csv’ and ‘CS2B_S23_Q1_Exposures.csv’
contain the deaths and central exposed to risk, respectively, for English and Welsh
males for each age last birthday from 20 to 100 inclusive, in each year from 1961 to
2020 inclusive. The files contain both row and column headings.
(i) Construct R code to load the data files into R and to assign them to two 81 ×
60 matrices called ‘Deaths’ and ‘Exposures’ respectively. 
(ii) Generate an 81 × 60 matrix called ‘m_xt’, consisting of the crude central
mortality rates calculated by dividing the deaths by the exposures. 

---
Gompertz Law is fitted to the crude central mortality rates, mxt, for each calendar year
t separately using linear regression of the log central mortality rates on age x such
that:
𝑚􀯫􀯧 􀵌 exp􀵫α􀯧 􀵅 β􀯧􁈺𝑥 􀵆 𝑥̅􁈻􀵯
(iii) Generate a 60 × 2 matrix called ‘Gompertz’, consisting of the values of αt and
βt for each calendar year t. Display the first six rows of Gompertz in your
answer script.

---

(iv) Plot two line graphs showing the values of αt and βt you fitted in part (iii) for
each calendar year t, displaying the graphs side-by-side in your answer script.

(v) Comment on the key features of your graphs in part (iv). [3]
(vi) Plot a graph showing the value of the chi-square goodness of fit statistic for
the Gompertz graduation for each calendar year t. [8]
(vii) Suggest with reasons, what further investigations should be carried out in view
of your graph in part (vi). [3]

(v)
alpha(t) exhibits a downward trend as t increases 
indicating a trend of improving mortality over time 
beta(t) is positive throughout 
indicating that mortality increases with age 
beta(t) exhibits no consistent trend as t increases 
indicating no consistent trend in the rate of increase of mortality with age 
beta(t) exhibits greater volatility from year to year than alpha(t) 
Both alpha(t) and beta(t) show sharp increases in 2020 due to the COVID-19
pandemic

plot(t, chisq, type = "l", main = "Chi-square statistic
as a function of t", xlab = "t", ylab = "Chi-square statistic") 

(vii)
The number of degrees of freedom to use in the chi-square test is 79 (= 81 - 2) 
Calculation of critical value using R or interpolation from Tables 
The chi-square statistics in the graph are therefore all highly significant 
Alternative models should therefore be investigated to improve the goodness of fit 
The chi-square statistic increases in the most recent years 
suggesting that there may be a particular need to improve the goodness of fit at the oldest ages 
since there will be more lives at those ages in the most recent years 
Maximum likelihood estimation should be investigated in place of linear regression 
This is equivalent to linear regression with the data points weighted by expected
deaths 
This will improve the fit at the ages with the highest numbers of deaths 
Alternatively, linear regression with weighting by actual deaths could be used
