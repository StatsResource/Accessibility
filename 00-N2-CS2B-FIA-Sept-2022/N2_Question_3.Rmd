CS2B S2022–5
3 The dataset ‘CS2B_S22_Qu_3_Data.csv’ contains the following four variables: mpg,
disp, qsec, hp.
You are tasked to build a regression model to explain the response, hp, in terms of the
features mpg, disp and qsec. Thus, the model must be in the form:
yi = β0 + β1*mpgi + β2*dispi + β3*qseci + εi
where β0, β1, β2 and β3 are the regression parameters and ε represents the error term.
This model can be written compactly as:
y = X β + ε
where y is the vector containing the response data and X is the design matrix.
(i) Write R code to load the dataset ‘CS2B_S22_Qu_3_Data.csv’ into R, create
the design matrix, X, including column headings and display the first six rows
of this design matrix.
[Note: The X you create must be of the type ‘matrix’.] 
You would like to fit the above model by minimizing the following:
||y – X β||2 +
λ
2 ||β||2
It can be shown that, for a given value of λ, the estimate βλ of β that minimises the
expression above is such that:
􁈺Xt X + λ*I􁈻 βλ = Xt y
where I is the identity matrix and Xt is the transpose of X.
(ii) State the name of this modelling approach. [1]
(iii) Construct an R function, ridge_fit, that takes as inputs the value of λ, the
vector of response data and the design matrix, and then returns the value of
βλ = 􁈺Xt X + λ*I􁈻–1 Xt y.
[Hint: The R function solve can be used to compute the inverse of a matrix.
That is, for a given invertible matrix, M, its inverse, M–1, can be computed in
R by running the following code: solve(M).] [6]
(iv) Calculate and display the value of the vector β2 (i.e. the value of vector βλ for
λ = 2). 
(v) Construct R code to compute the values of the vectors βλ and store them into
successive rows of a matrix named matrix_LAMBDA, for λ = i/10, where
i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10,000.

(vi) Display the top six rows of matrix_LAMBDA. [1]
You would like to select the best value of λ. A senior statistician suggests that you
should base your selection on a statistical information criterion. However, most
statistical information criteria depend on the so-called effective dimension of the
model. For this task, it can be shown that the effective dimension is the sum of the
diagonal elements of the following matrix: X(XtX + λ*I)–1Xt.
(vii) Construct an R function called dim_fit that takes as inputs the design
matrix and the value of λ, and then returns the corresponding effective
dimension. [6]
(viii) Construct R code to compute the values of the effective dimensions and store
them in a vector called vector_dim, for λ = i/10, where
i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10,000. 
(ix) Plot the effective dimension as a function of λ. 
(x) Comment on your plot from part (ix).
