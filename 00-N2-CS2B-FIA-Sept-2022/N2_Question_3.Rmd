CS2B S2022–5
3 The dataset ‘CS2B_S22_Qu_3_Data.csv’ contains the following four variables: mpg,
disp, qsec, hp.
You are tasked to build a regression model to explain the response, hp, in terms of the
features mpg, disp and qsec. Thus, the model must be in the form:
yi = $\beta$0 + $\beta$1*mpgi + $\beta$2*dispi + $\beta$3*qseci + εi
where $\beta$0, $\beta$1, $\beta$2 and $\beta$3 are the regression parameters and ε represents the error term.
This model can be written compactly as:
y = X $\beta$ + ε
where y is the vector containing the response data and X is the design matrix.

---

(i) Write R code to load the dataset ‘CS2B_S22_Qu_3_Data.csv’ into R, create
the design matrix, X, including column headings and display the first six rows
of this design matrix.
[Note: The X you create must be of the type ‘matrix’.] 
You would like to fit the above model by minimizing the following:
||y – X $\beta$||2 +
$\lambda$
2 ||$\beta$||2
It can be shown that, for a given value of $\lambda$, the estimate $\beta$$\lambda$ of $\beta$ that minimises the
expression above is such that:
􁈺Xt X + $\lambda$*I􁈻 $\beta$$\lambda$ = Xt y
where I is the identity matrix and Xt is the transpose of X.
(ii) State the name of this modelling approach. 
(iii) Construct an R function, ridge_fit, that takes as inputs the value of $\lambda$, the
vector of response data and the design matrix, and then returns the value of
$\beta$$\lambda$ = 􁈺Xt X + $\lambda$*I􁈻–1 Xt y.
[Hint: The R function solve can be used to compute the inverse of a matrix.
That is, for a given invertible matrix, M, its inverse, M–1, can be computed in
R by running the following code: solve(M).] [6]
(iv) Calculate and display the value of the vector $\beta$2 (i.e. the value of vector $\beta$$\lambda$ for
$\lambda$ = 2). 
(v) Construct R code to compute the values of the vectors $\beta$$\lambda$ and store them into
successive rows of a matrix named matrix_LAMBDA, for $\lambda$ = i/10, where
i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10,000. 

--- 

(vi) Display the top six rows of matrix_LAMBDA. 
You would like to select the best value of $\lambda$. A senior statistician suggests that you
should base your selection on a statistical information criterion. However, most
statistical information criteria depend on the so-called effective dimension of the
model. For this task, it can be shown that the effective dimension is the sum of the
diagonal elements of the following matrix: X(XtX + $\lambda$*I)–1Xt.
(vii) Construct an R function called dim_fit that takes as inputs the design
matrix and the value of $\lambda$, and then returns the corresponding effective
dimension. [6]
(viii) Construct R code to compute the values of the effective dimensions and store
them in a vector called vector_dim, for $\lambda$ = i/10, where
i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10,000. 
(ix) Plot the effective dimension as a function of $\lambda$. 
(x) Comment on your plot from part (ix).
