***CS2B – Risk Modelling and Survival Analysis ***


* The emphasis is placed on being able to apply statistical methods to actuarial problems using real data sets and the open-source software environment R. 

* Time Series. Probability Distributions, Survival Analysis

CS2B S2022–3
2 Before answering this question, the survival package should be loaded into R with the
following code:
install.packages("survival")
library(survival)
The government of Country U has asked a non-profit organization to study possible
adverse effects of a new vaccine administered to individuals, with particular reference
to the possibility of blood clots within the first 28 days of receipt of a vaccine.
Before answering this question, the ‘CS2B_S22_Qu_2_Data.csv’ file should be
loaded into R and assigned to a data frame called ‘data’. This .csv file contains the
data from an investigation for 2,400 individuals. The file contains the following six
variables:
Life: patient identifier (integers 1, 2, … 2,400)
Drug: indicator (1 = received vaccine, 0 = did not receive vaccine)
Age: indicator (0 = age less than or equal to 50, 1 = age greater than 50)
co_morbidity: indicator (1 = individual has another chronic disease at the time of
receipt of vaccination, 0 = no chronic disease)
Status: indicator (0 = censoring due to the end of period, 1 = censoring due to death
(reason unknown), 2 = admission to hospital due to blood clots within 28 days of
receipt of vaccine, 3 = admission to hospital due to reasons other than blood clots
within 28 days of receipt of vaccine)
Time: duration in days at which admission to hospital/censoring occurred (integers
with a range of 0–28; 0 = day of vaccination).
(i) Comment on whether the censoring in this investigation is likely to be
non-informative. [3]
(ii) Construct a table named ‘data_main’, which is the same as ‘data’ but with a
new column added. The newly added column should be named ‘ST’ and
should contain the values:
*  0 if ‘Status’ in ‘data’ is 0 or 1 or 3
*  1 if ‘Status’ in ‘data’ is 2.
Display the last 20 rows of ‘data_main’. [6]
(iii) Plot the Kaplan–Meier survival functions required to analyse the effect of
vaccination on blood clots assuming that censoring is non-informative. You
should plot both survival functions on the same axes, using separate colours to
identify each survival function. You should use a range from 0.97 to 1 on the
y-axis. [9]
(iv) Comment on your plot from part (iii).

Analysts in the organization have decided to analyse further by using Cox’s
proportional hazards model and by adding covariates into the investigation.
The following decisions were made:
*  Significance of covariates would be tested with interactions.
*  At least two covariates would be used.
*  Two covariates to be compulsorily used are vaccine indicator and age.
They are now deciding to add one more covariate: co-morbidity.
(v) Test the hypothesis, using the likelihood ratio statistic, that co-morbidity has
no effect on blood clots allowing for vaccine indicator and age, stating the null
and alternative hypotheses and using the Breslow method for tie handling.
