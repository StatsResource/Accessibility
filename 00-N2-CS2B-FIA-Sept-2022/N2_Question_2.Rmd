CS2B S2022–3
2 Before answering this question, the survival package should be loaded into R with the
following code:
install.packages("survival")
library(survival)
The government of Country U has asked a non-profit organization to study possible
adverse effects of a new vaccine administered to individuals, with particular reference
to the possibility of blood clots within the first 28 days of receipt of a vaccine.
Before answering this question, the ‘CS2B_S22_Qu_2_Data.csv’ file should be
loaded into R and assigned to a data frame called ‘data’. This .csv file contains the
data from an investigation for 2,400 individuals. The file contains the following six
variables:
Life: patient identifier (integers 1, 2, … 2,400)
Drug: indicator (1 = received vaccine, 0 = did not receive vaccine)
Age: indicator (0 = age less than or equal to 50, 1 = age greater than 50)
co_morbidity: indicator (1 = individual has another chronic disease at the time of
receipt of vaccination, 0 = no chronic disease)
Status: indicator (0 = censoring due to the end of period, 1 = censoring due to death
(reason unknown), 2 = admission to hospital due to blood clots within 28 days of
receipt of vaccine, 3 = admission to hospital due to reasons other than blood clots
within 28 days of receipt of vaccine)
Time: duration in days at which admission to hospital/censoring occurred (integers
with a range of 0–28; 0 = day of vaccination).

(i) Comment on whether the censoring in this investigation is likely to be
non-informative. [3]
(ii) Construct a table named ‘data_main’, which is the same as ‘data’ but with a
new column added. The newly added column should be named ‘ST’ and
should contain the values:
*  0 if ‘Status’ in ‘data’ is 0 or 1 or 3
*  1 if ‘Status’ in ‘data’ is 2.
Display the last 20 rows of ‘data_main’. [6]
(iii) Plot the Kaplan–Meier survival functions required to analyse the effect of
vaccination on blood clots assuming that censoring is non-informative. You
should plot both survival functions on the same axes, using separate colours to
identify each survival function. You should use a range from 0.97 to 1 on the
y-axis. [9]
(iv) Comment on your plot from part (iii). 

**Part (i) Non-Informative Censoring**

Censoring in this investigation is likely to be **non-informative**. This means that the reason for censoring is unrelated to the event of interest (blood clots). In this case, individuals are censored due to the end of the study period or death from other causes. These events are not influenced by the risk of developing blood clots. 

**Part (ii) Creating the `data_main` Table**

```R
data_main <- data
data_main$ST <- ifelse(data_main$Status == 2, 1, 0)
tail(data_main, 20)
```

**Part (iii) Plotting Kaplan-Meier Survival Functions**

```R
# Create survival objects for vaccinated and unvaccinated groups
fit1 <- survfit(Surv(Time, ST) ~ Drug, data = data_main)

# Plot the Kaplan-Meier curves
plot(fit1, conf.int = FALSE, col = c("blue", "red"), xlab = "Time (days)", ylab = "Survival Probability", ylim = c(0.97, 1))
legend("topright", legend = c("Vaccinated", "Unvaccinated"), col = c("blue", "red"), lty = 1)
```

**Part (iv) Commenting on the Plot**

The Kaplan-Meier curves show the probability of surviving without developing blood clots over time for both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. The curves diverge, indicating a difference in survival probabilities between the two groups. The vaccinated group appears to have a lower survival probability, suggesting a potential association between vaccination and blood clots. However, further statistical analysis is needed to confirm this association and assess its significance.

Analysts in the organization have decided to analyse further by using Cox’s
proportional hazards model and by adding covariates into the investigation.
The following decisions were made:
*  Significance of covariates would be tested with interactions.
*  At least two covariates would be used.
*  Two covariates to be compulsorily used are vaccine indicator and age.
They are now deciding to add one more covariate: co-morbidity.
(v) Test the hypothesis, using the likelihood ratio statistic, that co-morbidity has
no effect on blood clots allowing for vaccine indicator and age, stating the null
and alternative hypotheses and using the Breslow method for tie handling.

**Part (v) Testing the Effect of Co-morbidity**

**Null Hypothesis (H0):** Co-morbidity has no effect on the hazard of blood clots, given the effects of vaccine indicator and age.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** Co-morbidity has an effect on the hazard of blood clots, given the effects of vaccine indicator and age.

**R Code for Cox Proportional Hazards Model:**

```R
cox_model <- coxph(Surv(Time, ST) ~ Drug + Age + co_morbidity + Drug:Age + Drug:co_morbidity + Age:co_morbidity, data = data_main, ties = "breslow")

# Test the significance of co-morbidity
anova(cox_model, test = "Chisq")
```

The `anova` function in R will perform a likelihood ratio test to compare nested models. In this case, we are comparing the full model with the reduced model that excludes the `co_morbidity` term.

**Interpretation of Results:**

The p-value from the likelihood ratio test will indicate the significance of the `co_morbidity` term. If the p-value is less than the significance level (e.g., 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that co-morbidity does have a significant effect on the hazard of blood clots, even after accounting for the effects of vaccine indicator and age.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Model Assumptions:** Before interpreting the results, it's important to check the proportional hazards assumption. This can be done using graphical methods (e.g., Schoenfeld residuals) or formal statistical tests.
* **Multiple Testing:** If multiple covariates are being tested, consider adjusting the significance level to control for multiple comparisons (e.g., Bonferroni correction).
* **Clinical Relevance:** While statistical significance is important, it's also crucial to assess the clinical significance of the findings. This involves considering the magnitude of the effect and its practical implications.

By following these steps and carefully interpreting the results, you can gain valuable insights into the factors affecting the risk of blood clots after vaccination.
