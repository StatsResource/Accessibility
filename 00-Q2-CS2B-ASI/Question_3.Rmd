(vi)
# The results suggest that Green crackers reduces the respiratory disorder ra
te of the workers by around 51% irrespective of males and females
# The results also suggests the hazard rate of males is 71% more than that of 
the females
# The interaction effect is not clearly visible as the decrease in hazard rat
e is similar among males and females.
# The p-values of both the coefficients are less than 0.05 indicating that bo
th the effects are statistically significant at 5%.

(ix) The green crackers reduced in a reduction in respiratory disorder for b
oth males and females though the decrease was slightly lesser in case of male
s
# The p-value of the interaction effect is >0.05 indicating that the interact
ion effect is not statistically significant.

(x) Both the results are communicating that the green crackers reduce the res
piratory disorders
