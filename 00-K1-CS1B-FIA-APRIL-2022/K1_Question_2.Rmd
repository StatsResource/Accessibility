#### Exercise 

A. Simulate a sample of 100 values from a ***Beta*** distribution with 
parameters $a = 3$, $b = 1$.
Use the command <tt>set.seed(12345)</tt> to 
initialise the random number generator, before you start the simulation. 

B. Plot a histogram of the sample simulated in part (A). 

C. Comment on the shape of the histogram produced in part (B). 

---

#### Part (A)

R code:

```{r}
set.seed(12345)
x = rbeta(100,3,1) 
```

---

#### Part (B)

R code:

```{r}
hist(x, main="Histogram of 100 values from Beta(3,1) distribution") 
```

---

#### Part (c)
The histogram is heavily skewed. 
This is consistent with the skewness of a Beta(3,1) distribution, which is negative for 
(𝛼𝛼 > 𝛽𝛽), see “Formula and Tables …”, page 13. 




---

#### Exercises

D. Perform 1,000 repetitions of the simulation in part (A). 

You should compute and store the value of the mean of the sample for each 
repetition. 

Recall: Use the command <tt>set.seed(12345)</tt> to initialise the 
random number generator, before you start the simulation. 

E. Plot a histogram of the 1,000 sample means computed in part (D). 

F. Comment on the shape of the histogram produced in part (E) by 
referring to a fundamental statistical property.  

---

### Part (D)

R code:

```{r}
set.seed(12345)
nsim = 1000 
xbar = numeric(nsim) 
for (i in 1:nsim){ 
x = rbeta(100,3,1) 
xbar[i] = mean(x) 
}
```




---

### using <tt>replicate()</tt>


Alternative code may be used. For example, without using a loop:

```{r}
set.seed(12345)

xbar <- replicate(1000,
                  mean(rbeta(100,3,1)) )

```

---

#### Part (E)

```{r}
hist(xbar, main="Histogram of sample mean") 
```

---



#### Part (F)


* The distribution of the sample mean is roughly symmetrical. 
* This demonstrates the CLT where the distribution of the sample mean is
approximately normal for large sample size.

#### Exercises



For the remaining parts of the question consider the following small sample of data 
(given here in R code): 

<pre><code>
y <- c(4.9, 3.3, 2.2, 2.3, 1.6, 2.4, 4.7, 1.4, 1.7, 5.1) 
</code></pre>

G. Determine a 90% confidence interval for the population mean of these data, 
stating any assumptions that you make. 

H. Determine an estimate of the standard error of the sample mean using these 
data.  

---




#### Part (c)

(iii)
R code:

```{r}


y = c(4.9, 3.3, 2.2, 2.3, 1.6, 2.4, 4.7, 1.4, 1.7, 5.1)
t.test(y, conf.level =0.90) 
# 2.124776 3.795224

```

---


#### Alternative R code:

```{r}
mean(y)-qt(0.95, length(y)-1) * sd(y)/sqrt(length(y))
mean(y)+qt(0.95, length(y)-1) * sd(y)/sqrt(length(y))
```
We have assumed that the data come from a normal distribution. 
CI is given by (2.125, 3.795) 

---

#### Part (d)

(iv)
R code:
```{r}

se.t = sd(y)/sqrt(length(y))
se.t 

```

# 0.4556314
Standard error of sample mean = 0.456. 
---

#### Part (e)


(v)
R code:

```{r}

set.seed(12345)
nsim = 10^4 
ybar.sim = numeric(nsim) 
for (i in 1:nsim){ 
y.sim = sample(y, replace=T) 
ybar.sim[i] = mean(y.sim) 
}
se.boot = sd(ybar.sim); se.boot 

```



---
I. Determine an estimate of the standard error of the sample mean using 
bootstrap with a bootstrap sample size of 10,000. 

Use the command 
<tt>set.seed(12345)</tt> to initialise the random number generator, before you 
start the bootstrap sampling. 

J. Determine a bootstrap 90% confidence interval for the population 
mean of the y data using the same bootstrap sample as in part (v). 

K. Comment on the two confidence intervals produced in parts (iii) and 
(vi)(a). 

---

Bootstrap standard error of sample mean = 0.432. 
Alternative code may be used. For example, without using a loop:

```{r}


set.seed(12345)
sd(replicate(10000, mean(sample(y, replace = T))))

```

---

(vi)(a)

We can use the output from part (v) and the R code:

```{r}
boot.ci.1 = quantile(ybar.sim, c(0.05,0.95)); boot.ci.1 

```

The 90% CI is (2.27, 3.69). 

---

The CI is now narrower; this suggests that the data may not be from a Normal distribution 
and the statistic 𝑋𝑋�−𝜇𝜇
𝑆𝑆
√𝑛𝑛 � may not follow a 𝑡𝑡9 distribution, as suggested in part (iii).
