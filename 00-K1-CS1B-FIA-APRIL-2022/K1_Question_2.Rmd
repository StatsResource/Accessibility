2 (i) (a) Simulate a sample of 100 values from a Beta distribution with 
parameters a = 3, b = 1. Use the command set.seed(12345)to 
initialise the random number generator, before you start the simulation. 
(b) Plot a histogram of the sample simulated in part (i)(a). 
(c) Comment on the shape of the histogram produced in part (i)(b). 
[6] 
(ii) (a) Perform 1,000 repetitions of the simulation in part (i)(a). You should 
compute and store the value of the mean of the sample for each 
repetition. Use the command set.seed(12345) to initialise the 
random number generator, before you start the simulation. [5] 
(b) Plot a histogram of the 1,000 sample means computed in part (ii)(a). 
  
(c) Comment on the shape of the histogram produced in part (ii)(b) by 
referring to a fundamental statistical property.  
For the remaining parts of the question consider the following small sample of data 
(given here in R code): 
y = c(4.9, 3.3, 2.2, 2.3, 1.6, 2.4, 4.7, 1.4, 1.7, 5.1) 
(iii) Determine a 90% confidence interval for the population mean of these data, 
stating any assumptions that you make. [3] 
(iv) Determine an estimate of the standard error of the sample mean using these 
data.  
(v) Determine an estimate of the standard error of the sample mean using 
bootstrap with a bootstrap sample size of 10,000. Use the command 
set.seed(12345) to initialise the random number generator, before you 
start the bootstrap sampling. [7] 
(vi) (a) Determine a bootstrap 90% confidence interval for the population 
mean of the y data using the same bootstrap sample as in part (v). 
(b) Comment on the two confidence intervals produced in parts (iii) and 
(vi)(a).

Q2
(i)(a)
R code:
set.seed(12345)
x = rbeta(100,3,1) 
(b)
R code:
hist(x, main="Histogram of 100 values from Beta(3,1) distribution")

(c)
The histogram is heavily skewed. 
This is consistent with the skewness of a Beta(3,1) distribution, which is negative for 
(𝛼𝛼 > 𝛽𝛽), see “Formula and Tables …”, page 13. 
(ii)(a)
R code:
set.seed(12345)
nsim = 1000 [½]
xbar = numeric(nsim) 
for (i in 1:nsim){ 
x = rbeta(100,3,1) 
xbar[i] = mean(x) 
Alternative code may be used. For example, without using a loop:
set.seed(12345)
xbar <- replicate(1000,mean(rbeta(100,3,1)))
(b)
hist(xbar, main="Histogram of sample mean")

(c)
The distribution of the sample mean is roughly symmetrical. 
This demonstrates the CLT where the distribution of the sample mean is
approximately normal for large sample size. 
(iii)
R code:
y = c(4.9, 3.3, 2.2, 2.3, 1.6, 2.4, 4.7, 1.4, 1.7, 5.1)
t.test(y, conf.level =0.90) 
# 2.124776 3.795224
Alternative R code:
mean(y)-qt(0.95, length(y)-1)*sd(y)/sqrt(length(y))
mean(y)+qt(0.95, length(y)-1)*sd(y)/sqrt(length(y))
We have assumed that the data come from a normal distribution. 
CI is given by (2.125, 3.795) 
(iv)
R code:
se.t = sd(y)/sqrt(length(y)); se.t 
# 0.4556314
Standard error of sample mean = 0.456. 
(v)
R code:
set.seed(12345)
nsim = 10^4 [½]
ybar.sim = numeric(nsim) [½]
for (i in 1:nsim){ 
y.sim = sample(y, replace=T) 
ybar.sim[i] = mean(y.sim) 
##########################
CS1B A2022 © Institute and Faculty of Actuaries
se.boot = sd(ybar.sim); se.boot 
# 0.4318923
Bootstrap standard error of sample mean = 0.432. 
Alternative code may be used. For example, without using a loop:
set.seed(12345)
sd(replicate(10000, mean(sample(y, replace = T))))
(vi)(a)
We can use the output from part (v) and the R code:
boot.ci.1 = quantile(ybar.sim, c(0.05,0.95)); boot.ci.1 
# 2.27 3.69 
The 90% CI is (2.27, 3.69). 
(b)
The CI is now narrower; 
this suggests that the data may not be from a Normal distribution 
and the statistic 𝑋𝑋�−𝜇𝜇
𝑆𝑆
√𝑛𝑛 � may not follow a 𝑡𝑡9 distribution, as suggested in part (iii).

Candidates overall answered well this question.
In certain parts requiring the use of the seed() command, some candidates presented 
numerical and graphical answers that differed from those shown in the solutions, despite 
following the correct procedure. This suggests that the seed() command was not used 
properly throughout the question. 
In part (i)(c) alternative comments, e.g. relating to the mean or variance of the 
distribution, received credit as appropriate. 
In part (ii)(b) (and similar parts), presenting both the code and the resulting graph is 
required for full marks. 
In part (iv) a common error was to give the standard deviation of y as the final answer. In 
part (v) a range of coding variations were presented and received appropriate credit 
where correct. Approaches using parametric bootstrap assuming a normal distribution
were also given credit. 
In part (vi)(b), similar reasonable comments were given credit as appropriate.
