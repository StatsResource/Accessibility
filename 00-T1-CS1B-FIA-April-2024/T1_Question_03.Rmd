A Multiple-Choice (MC) test with 20 questions requires a minimum of 16 correct
answers for students to pass the test. A student prepares for the test using a mobile
phone application that generates random practice tests with 20 questions per test.

Load the file <tt>MCtestResults.Rdata</tt> into R. 

This creates two variables:

1. ***CorrectOutOf20Questions*** – this contains the number of correct answers the student has achieved with the mobile phone application in each of 50 generated practice MC tests.
2. ***TrialNumber*** – this contains the corresponding test number from 1 to 50.

The student assumes that the test score, 𝑋, which is the number of correctly answered
questions per test, has a binomial distribution, 𝑋 ∼ Bin􁈺𝑛, 𝑝􁈻 with 𝑛 􀵌 20.

(i) Estimate the parameter 𝑝 using the test scores in MCtestResults.Rdata,
assuming that the test scores are independent of each other and identically
distributed. 

(ii) Calculate the probability that the student will pass a test based on your
estimate of 𝑝 in part (i). 
(iii) Calculate the proportion of practice tests that the student has passed. 
(iv) Comment on the probability that the student will pass a test, based on your
answers to parts (i), (ii) and (iii). [4]
(v) Plot the number of correct answers in each of the practice tests against the test
number on the horizontal axis. 
(vi) Comment on the plot in part (v). 
A linear model is fitted to the data, which predicts that the number of correct answers
in the next test (test number 51) will be 18.085.
(vii) Calculate the probability for the student to pass the next test (test number 51).

Q3
(i)
p = sum(CorrectOutOf20Questions)/(50 * 20) 
p # 0.568 
•
(ii)
# probability to pass the test is P[correct answers > 15]
1 - pbinom(15, 20, p)  # 0.02747446 
(iii)
sum(CorrectOutOf20Questions>15)/50 
# 0.18 
(iv)
The results in (ii) and (iii) are both estimates of the success probability in a MC test.
The difference is that the answer in part (ii) relies on the estimate from part (i) and therefore takes the whole distribution of test results (the actual points achieved) into account, 
while the answer in part (iii) turns the test results into a Bernoulli RV (1 for pass and 0 for fail). Therefore, in part (iii) it does not matter by how far away the result is from the pass mark while it does matter for the answer in part (ii).

(v)
plot(TrialNumber, CorrectOutOf20Questions ylim=c(0,20),
main = “Correct answers per test",
ylab="Number of correct answers (out of 20)", xlab="Test number") 

(vi)
The plot in part (v) shows an upward trend, or positive correlation between test number and the number of correct answers. 
Suggesting that the student is improving their results with practicing. 
(vii)
Estimated probability of answering a question correctly:
p = 18.085/20 
p # 0.90425 
# prob for passing test
1 - pbinom(15, 20, p) # 0.9632752 
[Total 18]

Commentary:
(i) Very well answered.
(ii) Well answered in general. A common error was using 16 instead of 15 in the CDF (pbinom) calculation.
(iii) Well answered overall.
(iv) Not answered well. A number of candidates failed to provide meaningful comments, with many repeating the numerical results.
(v) Good answers. As in previous questions involving graphs, some candidates did not provide informative titles and/or axis labels.
(vi) There were mixed answers in this part. Most candidates described the positive correlation, but few suggested improvement as a result of practice.
(vii) Answers were mixed, with a number of candidates not attempting this part.
