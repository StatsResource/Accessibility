3 A Multiple-Choice (MC) test with 20 questions requires a minimum of 16 correct
answers for students to pass the test. A student prepares for the test using a mobile
phone application that generates random practice tests with 20 questions per test.
Load the file MCtestResults.Rdata into R. This creates two variables:
CorrectOutOf20Questions – this contains the number of correct answers the
student has achieved with the mobile phone application in each of 50 generated
practice MC tests.
TrialNumber – this contains the corresponding test number from 1 to 50.
The student assumes that the test score, 𝑋, which is the number of correctly answered
questions per test, has a binomial distribution, 𝑋 ∼ Bin􁈺𝑛, 𝑝􁈻 with 𝑛 􀵌 20.
(i) Estimate the parameter 𝑝 using the test scores in MCtestResults.Rdata,
assuming that the test scores are independent of each other and identically
distributed. [2]
(ii) Calculate the probability that the student will pass a test based on your
estimate of 𝑝 in part (i). [2]
(iii) Calculate the proportion of practice tests that the student has passed. [1]
(iv) Comment on the probability that the student will pass a test, based on your
answers to parts (i), (ii) and (iii). [4]
(v) Plot the number of correct answers in each of the practice tests against the test
number on the horizontal axis. [3]
(vi) Comment on the plot in part (v). [2]
A linear model is fitted to the data, which predicts that the number of correct answers
in the next test (test number 51) will be 18.085.
(vii) Calculate the probability for the student to pass the next test (test number 51).
