2 A financial consultancy working with large firms wishes to model the relationship
between a firm’s assets and the number of senior management positions in the firm.
The data file firms.Rdata contains the variables:
assets – this is the value of assets (in millions of £).
sn_positions – this is the number of senior managements positions.
You can load the file into R using load("firms.Rdata").
(i) Plot the number of senior management positions as a function of assets. [3]
(ii) Plot the number of senior management positions as a function of log10_assets
where log10_assets is the assets at log10 scale. [4]
(iii) Comment on your plots in parts (i) and (ii). [2]
An analyst wishes to check if the number of senior management positions follows a
Poisson distribution.
(iv) Calculate the mean of the number of senior management positions. [1]
Use the command set.seed(222) to initialise the random number generator.
(v) Generate a sample of size equal to the number of firms from a Poisson
distribution with parameter equal to the mean calculated in part (iv). [2]
(vi) Plot a histogram of the sample simulated in part (v) and a histogram of
sn_positions on two separate graphs but on the same scale specifying
appropriate axis limits and labels. [6]
(vii) Comment on your plots in part (vi). [3]
