1 An insurance company wants to study the association between the number of years
their clients spent in education and their claim amounts.
Data from 25 randomly selected claims are contained in the file
AmountYears.RData in the following two variables:
ClaimAmount – this is the claim amount (in £).
EducationYears – this is the number of years the client spent in education.
(i) Plot the claim amounts against the years of education. [3]
A statistician suggests fitting a simple linear model to the data.
(ii) (a) Fit a linear model to the data. [2]
(b) Plot the regression line by adding it to the graph in part (i). [2]
Another statistician looks at the plot in part (i) and suggests a non-linear relationship.
(iii) (a) Fit a model with a quadratic term added to the model fitted in part (ii).
[3]
(b) State the equation of the fitted model. [1]
(iv) Comment on the suitability of the quadratic model in part (iii), compared to
the model in part (ii), based on the output from part (iii). [3]
