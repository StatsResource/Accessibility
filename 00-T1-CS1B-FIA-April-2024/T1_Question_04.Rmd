4 Consider a random variable, 𝑋, following a modified exponential distribution with
Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):
𝐹􁈺𝑥􁈻 􀵌 􀵜
0, 𝑥 􀵏 0
1 􀵆 exp􁈺􀵆𝜆𝑥􀬶􁈻, 𝑥􀵒0
(i) Plot the CDF 𝐹􁈺𝑥􁈻 as a function of 𝑥 for 𝑥 􀵌 0, 0.1, 0.2, … ,9.9, 10 when
λ 􀵌 0.2. [4]
(ii) Plot the density function 𝑓􁈺𝑥􁈻 of 𝑋 as a function of 𝑥 for
𝑥 􀵌 0, 0.1, 0.2, … ,9.9, 10 when λ 􀵌 0.2. [5]

A random sample of 100 values of X is provided in randomSample.Rdata.
Loading the sample data into R will generate a vector x with 100 values representing
the sample.
(iii) Calculate the value of the log likelihood function for the parameter λ at the
point λ 􀵌 0.2 based on this random sample. 
(iv) Plot the values of the log likelihood function for the parameter λ based on the
sample in randomSample.Rdata. Your plot of the log likelihood function
must be for values of λ 􀵌 0.01, 0.02, … , 0.99, 1. [7]
The maximum likelihood estimator for the parameter λ based on a random sample
𝑋􀬵, … , 𝑋􀯇 is given by:
λ􀷠
􀵌
𝑁
Σ 𝑋􀯜
􀯇 􀬶
􀯜􀭀􀬵
(v) Estimate the value of λ using the maximum likelihood estimator given above
and the sample in randomSample.Rdata. 
(vi) Comment on the plot in part (iv) and the estimate in part (v).

Q4
(i)
cdf
x = seq(0, 10, by = 0.1) 
lambda = 0.2 
F = 1-exp(- lambda * x^2) 
plot(x,F,main= "CDF of X") 
<p>
---


(ii) density
Differentiate 𝐹: 𝑓(𝑥)={0,𝑥<02𝜆𝑥exp(−𝜆𝑥2),𝑥≥0 
x = seq(0, 10, by = 0.1)
d = 2 * lambda * x * exp(-lambda * x^2) 
plot(x,d,main="Density of X") 
<p>
---


(iii)
#log likelihood
load("randomSample.Rdata")
d = 2 * lambda * x * exp(-lambda * x^2) 
ll = sum(log(d)) 
ll # -139.7437 
(iv)
#log likelihood for 100 values of lambda
ll = 1:100 
lambda = 1:100
for (k in 1:100) { 
lambda[k] = 0.01 * k 
ll[k] = sum(log(2 * lambda[k] * x * exp(-lambda[k] * x^2)))} 
<p>
---

plot(lambda,ll,main="Log likelihood") 

(v)
N = length(x) # sample size 
lambda.hat = N/sum(x^2) 
lambda.hat # 0.191256 
(vi)
The plot of the log likelihood function shows a maximum near 0.2, which is the MLE. 
That is consistent with the estimate obtained in part (v).

Commentary:
(i) Well answered in general.
(ii) Mixed answers. A common issue was errors in the differentiation.
(iii) Well answered in general.
(iv) There were mixed answers here, with many candidates producing the correct plot, but
<p>

there were various errors in many cases.
(v) Well answered in general. A small number of candidates failed to square x.
(vi) Well answered in general.
