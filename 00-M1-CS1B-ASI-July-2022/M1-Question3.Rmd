Q. 3) An analysis was carried out to investigate the annual average rainfall of two countries. 
The data is as below:
Iran: 128,125,133,104,146,132,125,118,129,124
Belgium:160,128,169,105,151,164,162,177,185,150,182,158,156,123,141,176,162,172

#### Exercises

1.  Perform a suitable test to determine whether the rainfall in both countries has equal 
variance or not, at the 5% confidence level. (6)
2.  Test whether the mean rainfall in both countries is equal or not, at 5% confidence 
level. 
3.   Calculate the 95% confidence interval for difference in means. 
4.  Comment on the results in part (2.  and (3.  .

```{r}
Iran <- c(128,125,133,104,146,132,125,118,129,124)
Belgium <- c(160,128,169,105,151,164,162,177,185,150,182,158,156,123,141,176,162,172)
```

---

Solution 3:
Part A
H0: Annual average rainfall of Belgium and Iran are same
H1: Annual average rainfall of Belgium and Iran are not same


```{r}
Iran <- c(128,125,133,104,146,132,125,118,129,124)
Belgium <- c(160,128,169,105,151,164,162,177,185,150,182,158,156,123,141,176,162,172)
```

---

```{r}
var.test(Iran, Belgium)
```


Since p-value < 0.05 we fail the variance test thus we reject the null hypothesis that both have equal 
variance

---

### Part B

```{r}
t.test(Iran, Belgium, var.equal = FALSE)
```


#### Conclusion

Since, P-value<0.05 we reject the null hypothesis and can conclude that both cities have different amount 
of rainfall with 95% confidence.

---

### Exercise C

* Confidence interval can be read from part B

* 95 percent confidence interval:
-42.79403 -17.85041

---

### Exercise D

* The confidence interval (-42.8,-17.8) does not contain 0. 
* Therefore the assumption of equal means is 
not true. 

* This result is in line with the conclusion in part (b).
