### Probability Distributions

Identify the probability distribution that best fits the below questions. Calculate the 
following using R functions:

A.  Assume golf balls from the driving range next door lands in your yard at an average 
rate of 3 balls per hour during the day. What is the probability that 10 or fewer golf 
balls will land in your yard during the afternoon, assuming the afternoon is 5 hours 
long? 

B.  You are surveying people exiting from a polling booth and asking them if they voted 
independently. The probability that a person voted independently is 20%. What is 
the probability that 70 people must be asked before you can find 5 people who voted 
independently?

C.   Assume you flip a fair coin 100 times. What is the number N such that, 90% of the 
time, the number of heads is less than or equal to N?

D.  A researcher is waiting outside of a library to ask people if they support a certain 
law. The probability that a given person supports the law is p = 0.2. What is the 
probability that the fourth person the researcher talks to is the first person to support
the law?

E.  Assume that a light bulb has a mean lifetime of 1000 hours. What is the probability 
that the light bulb survives to 2000 hours?

F.   Assume a random variable Z is distributed according to the normal distribution with 
mean 6 and standard deviation 4. What is the probability that Z takes on a value 
between -1 and 3?

Part D $$X ~ Geometric (0.2)$$

```{r}
dgeom(x=3, prob=0.2)
```

Part E X ~ Exp(1/1000)

```{r}
1 - pexp(2000, 0.001)
```

#### Part F.   

Assume a random variable Z is distributed according to the normal distribution with 
mean 6 and standard deviation 4. What is the probability that Z takes on a value 
between -1 and 3?

$$X ~ N(6,16)$$

```{r}
pnorm(3, 6, 4) - pnorm(-1, 6, 4)
```
