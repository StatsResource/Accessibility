Q. 2) In a study done at the National Institute of Science and Technology, asbestos fibers on 
filters were counted as part of a project to develop measurement standards for asbestos 
concentration.
An operator counted the number of fibers in each of 23 grid squares, yielding the 
following counts:
31,29,19,18,31,28, 34,27,34,30,16,18, 26,27,27,18,24,22, 28,24,21,17,24
Assume that the Poisson distribution with unknown parameter lambda describes the 
variability from each of the grid squares. 
i) Calculate Q1, Q3 and Inter-quartile range.
ii) Plot histogram of sample data and label it appropriately.
iii) Use the method of maximum likelihood to estimate the parameter lambda.
iv) Test the hypothesis whether the mean fiber count is equal to 25. Comment on the 
results.

v) Calculate the standard error of parameter lambda. (2)
vi) Calculate the 90% confidence interval for standard error.

vii)Calculate the probability of fiber count exceeding 30, with the help of Central Limit 
Theorem.
