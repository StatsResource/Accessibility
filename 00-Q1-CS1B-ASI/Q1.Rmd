We know the property that if X ~ Gamma(α,ʎ) then 2ʎX has χ2 distribution with 2α degrees of 
freedom.
We have X ~ χ2 with 2 degrees of freedom.
Above can be written as (2ʎX/2ʎ) ~ χ2 with 2α degrees of freedom where α=1,ʎ =1/2
Thus,
X ~ Gamma(α,ʎ) with α=1,ʎ =1/2
X ~ Gamma(1,1/2)
This is why both samples are same.
