An analyst collected samples of the prices (in £000s) of 25 one-bedroom flats in each 
of two different cities. The data from these two samples are saved in the file 
onebedflat.Rdata. After loading the data into R, using the command 
***load("onebedflat.Rdata")***, the data frame onebedflat with its variables 
listed below will be available. 

* City1: one-bedroom flat prices in the first city. 
* City2: one-bedroom flat prices in the second city. 

It is assumed that the two samples come from Normal populations with equal 
variances. 

---

#### Exercises

(i) Calculate an appropriate test statistic for the hypothesis of equal means in the 
two corresponding populations using these data.
(ii) Test at a 1% significance level whether the mean flat prices are the same in the 
two cities, against the alternative that they are different, based on your answer 
to part (i). 
---

The standard assumptions for a two-sided test of the hypothesis of equal means in two 
populations are that the populations: 

* (A1) follow Normal distributions 
* (A2) have equal variances. 

The analyst suspects that those assumptions may not be satisfied, and they are 
therefore interested in learning about the true significance level for such tests when 
assumptions (A1) and (A2) do not necessarily hold. 

With two independent samples, given a particular choice of the significance level, α, 
the true significance level for a two-sided test of the hypothesis of equal means can be 
calculated as 
$$αtrue ൌ 𝑃ሺ|test statistic| ൒ critical pointሻ,$$
where the critical point is the α/2 quantile of an appropriate distribution.

---

An estimate of the true significance level for this two-sided test, when the chosen 
level of significance is $\alpha = 0.1$, can be computed using the R Monte Carlo simulation 
code provided below: #

```{r}
set.seed(123) # 
alpha = 0.1 
m=20 
n=20 
N=8000 
nrej=0 

for (i in 1:N) { # 
	x=rnorm(m,mean=0,sd=1); y=rnorm(n,mean=0,sd=1) # 
	ts=t.test(x, y, var.equal=TRUE)$stat # 
	df = n+m-2 # 
	if (abs(ts)>=qt(1-alpha/2, df)) # 
		nrej=nrej+1 # 
	} 

alpha_est=nrej/N # 


```

Note that the code provided above lacks best practice of including appropriate 
comments.

### Part C 

Explain the provided code by placing comments after each ‘#’ sign in  the code. 

--- 

(iv) Estimate the true significance level, by using the code provided above, when 
the two populations are from a standard Normal distribution. 

---

#### Exercise 5

(v) Estimate the true significance level, by adjusting the code provided above to 
reflect the following pairs of populations: 

(a) The first population is from a standard Normal distribution and the 
second population is from a Normal distribution with mean 0 and
standard deviation 10. 

(b) The first population is from a Normal distribution with mean 10 and 
standard deviation 2 and the second population is from an Exponential 
distribution with mean 10. 

---

#### Exercise 6

Compare your estimates of the true significance level under all scenarios in 
the previous exercises, stating your conclusions.


Q5
(i)
```{r}
load("onebedflat.RData")
t.stat = t.test(City1, City2, var.equal=TRUE)$stat
t.stat
```
-6.010694 
---

(ii)
The p-value of the test is:

```{r}
(pt(-6.010694, 48))*2 
```

So, the p-value is 2.414801e-07 . 
The p-value is less than 1%, therefore the flat prices are not the same for the two cities 

---

(iii)

```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(123) # Set seed to allow replication of answers 
alpha = 0.1
m=20
n=20 
N=8000
nrej=0 
```
---


```{r }
set.seed(123) # Set seed to allow replication of answers 
alpha = 0.1
m=20
n=20 
N=8000
nrej=0 

for (i in 1:N) { # Run N = 8000 MC iterations 
x=rnorm(m,mean=0,sd=1); y=rnorm(n,mean=0,sd=1) 
# Simulate2 random samples of size 20 from N(0,1), i.e with same mean and variance 
ts=t.test(x, y, var.equal=TRUE)$stat 
# Compute the test statistic under assumption of equal variances 
df = n+m-2 
# Determine degrees of freedom 
if (abs(ts)>=qt(1-alpha/2, df)) # Determine if H0 should be rejected 
nrej=nrej+1 # Count number of rejections 
}
alpha_est=nrej/N 
# Compute estimated significance level as proportion ofrejections when H0 is true
```
