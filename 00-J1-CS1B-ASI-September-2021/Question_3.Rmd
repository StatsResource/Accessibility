Solution 3:
i) If X1, X2, …… Xn follows Bernoulli distribution with p = 0.5 (1)
Then Y follows binomial distribution ~ Bin(n,p) as sum of independent Bernoulli distribution 
results in binomial distribution with n trials and p is the probability of success. (1)
[2]
ii) Since ‘n’ is not specified in the question, sample simulations of Y can be generated assuming any 
value of ‘n’. The answer below is calculated using n = 10, however marks are allotted to 
simulations of Y, calculated using any value of ‘n’.
R Code
n = 10
p = 0.5
Y ~ rbinom(10, n, p)
Y
Values of y from R (since these are random values, answers for each individual may vary from 
the numbers stated below, please evaluate accordingly)
5 4 4 5 2 6 5 4 2 5 (2)
iii) The sample simulated in part (ii) are representative value of variable Y itself. Hence, no further 
calculation required to assess the value of variable Y. (2)
iv) dbinom (4,n,p)
The solution is based on assumption that n = 10 (as assumed in part(ii)). Marks are allotted to 
solutions calculated using any value for “n”.
