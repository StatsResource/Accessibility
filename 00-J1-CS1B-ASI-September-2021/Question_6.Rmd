Solution 6:
i) H0 – Company1 and Company2 having equal variance (i.e., ratio of variance =1)
H1 – There is a difference in variance between Company1 and Company2.
Company1<-c(1350,1790,1500,1150,2100,2350,1550,1800,1650,1450)
Company2<-c(1500,1200,1300,1700,1800,2400,1450,1950,1850,2100)
var.test(Company1,Company2)
F test to compare two variances
data: Company1 and Company2
F = 0.91388, num df = 9, denom df = 9, p-value = 0.8955
alternative hypothesis: true ratio of variances is not equal to 1
95 percent confidence interval:
0.2269944 3.6792680
sample estimates:
ratio of variances 
 0.9138781

Page 8 of 15
Conclusion – As the confidence interval for the ratio between variance includes 1, we do not 
have enough evidence to reject H0 at 5% significance level. Hence, we can conclude that ratio of 
variance between Company1 and Company2 is 1 i.e., Company1 and Company2 having equal 
variance at 5% significance level. (4)
ii) H0 – No difference in mean premium charged by Company1 and Company2. 
H1 – difference in mean premium charged by Company1 and Company2.
t.test(Company1, Company2, var.equal = TRUE, conf=0.95)
 Two Sample t-test
data: Company1 and Company2
t = -0.3433, df = 18, p-value = 0.7353
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
-398.703 286.703
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
 1669 1725
Conclusion – As the confidence interval for the difference in mean premium includes 0, we do 
not have enough evidence to reject H0 at 5% significance level. Hence, we can conclude that 
there is no difference between mean premium charged by Company1 and Company2 at 5% 
significance level. (4)
iii) H0 – mean premium charged by Company2 is INR 1500. 
H1 – mean premium charged by Company2 is greater than 1500.
t.test(Company2, mu=1500, alternative= c("greater"), conf=0.95)
 One Sample t-test
data: Company2
t = 1.9082, df = 9, p-value = 0.04436
alternative hypothesis: true mean is greater than 1500
95 percent confidence interval:
1508.858 Inf
sample estimates:
mean of x 
 1725
Conclusion – As the confidence interval for the mean premium does not include 1500, at 5% 
significance level we have enough evidence to reject null hypothesis. 
(p-value less than 5% also confirms that we have enough evidence to reject null hypothesis at 
5% significance level).
Hence, we can conclude that the mean premium charged by Company2 is greater than INR 1500 
at 5% significance level. (4)
iv) H0 – There is no difference in proportion of (policies that result in) claim between Company1 and 
Company2.

H1 – There is difference in proportion of (policies that result in) claim between Company1 and 
Company2.
prop.test(c(60,50),c(200,100),correct=FALSE)
 2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction
data: c(60, 50) out of c(200, 100)
X-squared = 11.483, df = 1, p-value = 0.0007023
alternative hypothesis: two.sided
95 percent confidence interval:
-0.31677833 -0.08322167
sample estimates:
prop 1 prop 2 
 0.3 0.5
Conclusion – As the confidence interval does not include 0 (or as p-value is less than 5%), we 
have sufficient evidence to reject null hypothesis at 5% significance level. Hence, we can 
conclude that there is difference in proportion of (policies that result in) claims between 
Company1 and Company2 at 5% significance level. (4)
v) H0 – There is no difference in ratio of claim frequency between group1 and other groups in 
Company2. 
H1 – Claim frequency of group1 is less than other groups in Company2.
poisson.test(c(65,45),c(250,110), conf=.975, alternative="less")
 Comparison of Poisson rates
data: c(65, 45) time base: c(250, 110)
count1 = 65, expected count1 = 76.389, p-value = 0.01358
alternative hypothesis: true rate ratio is less than 1
97.5 percent confidence interval:
0.0000000 0.9511753
sample estimates:
rate ratio 
0.6355556
Conclusion – As the confidence interval for the ratio does not include 1, at 2.5% significance level 
we have enough evidence to reject null hypothesis. 
(p-value less than 2.5% also confirms that we have enough evidence to reject null hypothesis at 
2.5% significance level).
Hence, we can conclude that the claim frequency of group1 (having premium less than INR 1500) 
is less than other groups in Company2. (4)
