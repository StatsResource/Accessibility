Consider a set of data generated by tossing a fair coin, letting x t = 1 when a head is obtained
and x t = −1 when a tail is obtained. Then, construct y t as
$$y t = 2 + 1.5x t − 0.5x t−1$$
Simulate data for three cases, one with a small sample size (n = 10), another one with a
moderate sample size (n = 100) and lastly with large sample size (n = 1000).


## Exercise 1
1.  Plot the series for all three cases.



```{r}

set.seed(101010)
x1 = 2*rbinom(11, 1, .5) - 1 # simulated sequence of coin tosses
x2 = 2*rbinom(101, 1, .5) - 1
x3 = 2*rbinom(1001, 1, .5) - 1
```


```{r}
y1 = 2 + filter(x1, sides=1, filter=c(1.5,-.5))[-1]
y2 = 2 + filter(x2, sides=1, filter=c(1.5,-.5))[-1]
y3 = 2 + filter(x3, sides=1, filter=c(1.5,-.5))[-1]
plot.ts(y1, type='s')
plot.ts(y2, type='s')
plot.ts(y3, type='s')





```

## Exercise 2 

Find the mean and variance and comment on results.




```{r}



c(mean(y1), mean(y2),mean(y3)) # the sample mean
c(var(y1), var(y2),var(y3)) # the variance


> c(mean(y1), mean(y2),mean(y3)) # the sample mean
 1.900 1.970 1.975
> c(var(y1), var(y2),var(y3)) # the variance
 3.433333 2.615253 2.582958
As the sample size increases, volatility reduces.
