2 Consider a sample of 1,000 insurance policies. For each policy, there is a record of 
whether the policyholder has submitted at least one claim during the last 6-month 
period, the age of the policyholder and the duration of the policy. The number of 
policies, X, with one or more submitted claims is modelled as a random variable with 
a Binomial distribution X ~ Binomial(1000, p). 
(i) State the underlying assumptions that lead to the choice of a Binomial 
distribution for X. [2] 
Use the command load("CS1policies.Rdata") to load the observed data into 
R. This will create a data frame called CS1policies with three entries in your R 
workspace. You can check the names of the entries with names(CS1policies): 
 age: age of the policyholder in years 
 duration: duration of the policy in months 
 claimed: takes the values 0 (no claim in 6-month period) or 1 (at least one claim 
in 6-month period). 
An Actuary wishes to fit different Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) to the data, 
assuming that the number of policies with one or more submitted claims has a 
Binomial distribution and the link function of the GLM is the logit function. 
(ii) Fit a GLM to the data such that p depends on the age of the policyholder and 
report the estimated parameter values. [5] 
(iii) Fit a GLM to the data such that p depends on the duration of the policy and 
report the estimated parameter values. [5] 
(iv) Compare the fit of the models in parts (ii) and (iii) using the deviance and 
the Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC). [3] 
(v) Fit a GLM to the data, such that p depends on both the age of the policyholder 
and the duration of the policy, and report the estimated parameter values. [5] 
(vi) Comment on which of the three models in parts (ii), (iii) and (v) is most 
appropriate, justifying your answer. [2]
