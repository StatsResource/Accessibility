The Logistic function can be defined by the function:

$$ f(ùë•) = \frac{1}{(1 + exp(-x))}$$

1. Create a function in R to calculate f(x). 

2. Create a plot of this function and evaluate it at values for x ranging from -10 to 10. Add appropriate x and y-axis labels.

#### Exercise 1
```{r}
logistic<-function(x){ 1/(1+exp(-x))}
```

```{r}
logistic(4)
```

---

```{r}
X <- seq(-10,10,by=0.25)
```

```{r}
logistic(X)
```


---

#### Exercise 2
```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(logistic,
  xlim = c(-10,10), 
  main = "Logistic Function", 
  ylab = "y=1/(1+exp(-x))")
```
---

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(logistic,
  xlim = c(-10,10), 
  main = "Logistic Function", 
  ylab = "y=1/(1+exp(-x))")
```
