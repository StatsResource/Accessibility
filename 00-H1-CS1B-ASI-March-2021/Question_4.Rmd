Part 1
=================

Five years of marketing expenditure and company sales by month 


Construct a scatterplot of the data. Comment on the relationship between the Sales & 
Spend based on the plot. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(budget$Spend,budget$Sales)
```

---

```{r, echo =FALSE} 
plot(budget$Spend,budget$Sales)
```

The above scatter plot shows a positive linear relationship between marketing Spend and Sales data. 


---

```{r} 
plot(budget$Spend,budget$Sales, pch=18, col="blue")
```

---

### Exercise  2


Calculate Pearson’s correlation coefficient between Sales and Spend of the company. 


```{r} 
cor(budget$Sales,budget$Spend) 

```

---

### Exercise  3

Perform a hypothesis test for the null hypothesis that Pearson’s population correlation 
coefficient is equal to zero, against the alternative that it is positive. You should report the 
p-value of the test and a clear conclusion. 


```{r eval=FALSE}
cor.test(budget$Spend,budget$Sales,
         method="pearson",
         alternative = "greater")
```

---

```{r}
cor.test(budget$Spend,budget$Sales,
         method="pearson",
         alternative = "greater")
```

* The p-value is $2.2 \times 10^{-16}$, showing very strong evidence against the null hypothesis. 

* Thus, we reject that the Pearson’s correlation coefficient is equal to 0 and conclude that it is positive. 

---

### Exercise  4

Perform a simple linear regression analysis on the data. 

Your answer should report the estimate of parameter sigma - The Residual standard error. 

```{r include = FALSE}
reg = lm(Sales ~ Spend, data = budget) 
summary(reg) 
```

---

```{r}
reg = lm(Sales ~ Spend, data = budget) 
summary(reg) 
```

From the output, the estimate of parameter sigma is 10,650. 

---

### Exercise  5


Plot the fitted line on the data scatterplot. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(budget$Spend,budget$Sales)
abline(reg) 
```



---

```{r}
plot(budget$Spend,budget$Sales)
abline(reg) 
```


---

### Exercise  6

State the proportion of the total variability of the responses explained by the model based on your output in Part 4. 

From the R output, the proportion of total variability of the responses explained by the model is 94.12%. 

---

### Exercise  7

Plot a graph of the residuals of the model fitted in Part 6 against the explanatory variable. 


```{r} 
plot(budget$Spend,residuals(reg))
```

---

### Exercise  8


Obtain a 99% confidence interval for parameter sigma. 

```{r}
es = resid(reg)
```


From the above, the confidence interval for parameter sigma is (-3630.15, 3630.15) 

---

### Exercise  9

Comment on the validity of the model based on results in exercises 7 and 8. 


#### Comments

Based on the results in both exercises 7 and 8, the errors seem to be close to zero and the 
confidence interval of residuals also contains 0. Hence the model seems to be a good fit.

Part 10
============================

Calculate the p-value of a hypothesis test for this suggestion (slope equal to 10), by 
creating a suitable test statistic. 

Let Ho: Beta = 10 and H1: Beta not equal to 10 

```{r}
b1 = (coef(reg))[['Spend']]
n = 60 
s = sqrt(sum(es^2)/(n-2))
```

---

```{r}
SE = s/sqrt(sum((budget$Spend-mean(budget$Spend))^2))
t = (b1-10)/SE 

#p-value
pt(t,58,lower.tail = FALSE)
```

```{r}
pvalue = 2*pt(t,58,lower.tail = FALSE)
pvalue 
```

---

Part 11
==================================

Comment on the suggestion in Part 11. 

* There is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis at 5% level of significance. 
* The slope can be assumed to be equal to 10 for this data. 

---


Part 12
==================================
Calculate the predicted amount of sales when the marketing spend is £4500. 


```{r} 
y = 3431.5592 + (b1*4500) 
y 

```

With a marketing spend of $4,500, the Sales would be $50,821.
