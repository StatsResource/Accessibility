Q. 4) Consider the Dataset “fraud.csv”. There are two feature variables (1) State and (2) 
Sum_insured indicating the geography of the insured and the size of the sum insured for 
1000 different life insurance policy claims. You are asked to perform the following 
computations:
i) Compute the number of fraudulent claims as a proportion of total number of claims. (2)
ii) Compute the proportion of total claims associated with a medium sum insured policy 
from state C3, based on the data provided. (3)
iii) Given the claim is a fraudulent claim compute the proportion of claims to be associated 
with a medium sum insured policy from state C3, based on the data provided. (4)
iv) Using the results in (i), (ii) and (iii) compute the probability of a fraudulent claim given 
that a new claim comes from state C3 and has a medium sum insured. (4)
v) Compute the proportion of fraudulent claims from medium sum insured policies from 
C3 as a proportion of total claims from medium sum insured policies from C3. (3)
vi) Compare the results obtained in (iv) and (v) with suitable explanation. (2)
vii) Provide two major limitations of computing the probability of a fraudulent claim using 
this method. (2)

data set, the Naive Bayes model will assign it zero probability and will not be able to make any 
predictions in this regard'
