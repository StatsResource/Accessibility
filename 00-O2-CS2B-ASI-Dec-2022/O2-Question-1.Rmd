Q. 1) As an Actuary working for company Actuaria, you have been asked to build a loss model 
to forecast the size of potential losses over the next year for Employers’ Liability class of 
business. You have been provided with data for 2,164 losses in the file “CS2BQ1.csv”.
Library required:
MASS
Set the seed in R to 1234 prior to carrying out the analysis
In order to build the model you have been asked to carry out the following analysis:
i) Load the loss data given in the csv file in R and create a data frame with name “loss”. (1)
ii) Find the mean and standard deviation of the loss data. (2)
iii) Assuming that the loss data comes from a lognormal distribution, use the method of 
moments to calculate the ‘mu’ and ‘sigma’ parameters of a lognormal distribution. It 
is mandatory to compute the parameters using the “R” code only. (3)
iv) Fit a lognormal distribution using method of Maximum Likelihood Estimation. You 
should use an appropriate function from the MASS package for fitting the distribution. 
Create 2 variables “mu1” and “sigma1” to read the parameters of the distribution that 
has been fit. (3)
v) Compare the parameters estimated approaches in part (iii) and part (iv) above and 
comment on any differences. (3)
vi) Simulate 1,000 losses from a lognormal distribution using the mu1 and sigma1.
Estimate the Simulated Mean and Standard deviation. (4)
vii) Create a ‘qqplot’ of the simulated losses against the actual losses and plot an ‘abline’ 
between 0 and 1 with appropriate labelling. (4)
viii) Comment on the fit of the loss distribution based on the qqplot. (3)
ix) Compute the percentiles from 0% to 100% using steps of 10% of the original loss data 
provided and the simulated losses. (3)
x) You have been asked to estimate the losses that would be expected to be retained 
within a policy excess of 20,000. Create two new columns “Retained” and 
“Transferred” to hold all the simulated losses that will be retained and not retained 
respectively. (3)
xi) Using the ‘quantile’ function estimate the percentiles from 0% to 100% using steps of 
10% of the Retained and Transferred simulated losses. (3)
xii) Combine the estimated percentiles for the Original losses, Simulated Losses, Retained 
and Transferred losses into a data frame with the first column showing the percentiles 
(i.e. 0%, 10% and so on). (3)
xiii) Comment on the percentile distributions and differences across them. (2)
xiv) Based on the estimated percentiles, you have been asked to estimate a technical price 
using the following formula:

xv) Compare the Technical Premium to the actual quote Premium of 70,000. (2)
xvi) Plot the cumulative distribution function for the Original, Simulated, Retained and 
Transferred Loss distributions in one plot. (4)

'Comment on the difference in percentile loss values
There are differences at the higher percentiles with the simulated losses being higher than the empirical
this reflects the lack of empirical data related to larger losses. The retained losses get capped at 20k 
at the 50th percentile suggesting that 1 out of 2 claims will get capped by the current policy Excess.'
