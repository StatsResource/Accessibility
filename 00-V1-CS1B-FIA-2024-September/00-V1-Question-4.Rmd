### Interview Panel

Two members of an interview panel (A and B) have scored a large number of
applicants (on a scale from 1 to 40), with the purpose of ranking the applicants
according to their suitability for a job position. 

The scores for a sample of twelve
applicants are given below, with SA and SB denoting the scores of interview panel
member A and B, respectively:



| Applicant | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **A Scores (SA)**       | 35 | 14 | 28 | 33 | 29 | 22 | 19 | 36 | 21 | 30 | 15 | 18 |
| **B Scores (SB)**       | 38 | 18 | 25 | 30 | 22 | 17 | 23 | 29 | 32 | 31 | 15 | 19 |

**Understanding the Problem:**

We're tasked with:

1. **Visualizing Agreement:** Plotting a graph to compare the two sets of scores.

2. **Calculating Correlation Coefficients:** Computing Pearson's, Spearman's, and Kendall's correlation coefficients.

3. **Hypothesis Testing:** Performing statistical tests to determine the significance of the correlation.

4. **Interpreting Results:** Drawing conclusions about the agreement between the two panel members' scores.

### Create the Data

```{r}
# Scores by panel members A and B
SA <- c(35, 14, 28, 33, 29, 22, 19, 36, 21, 30, 15, 18)
SB <- c(38, 18, 25, 30, 22, 17, 23, 29, 32, 31, 15, 19)
```

---
### Exercise A 

**Plot a suitable graph for assessing the agreement in the two panel members‚Äô scores**

A scatter plot is suitable for this purpose.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Scatter plot
plot(SA, SB, 
     main="Scatter Plot of Scores by Panel Members A and B", 
     xlab="Scores by Panel Member A",
     ylab="Scores by Panel Member B", 
     pch=19, cex=2.4, col="blue")

abline(lm(SB ~ SA), 
       col="red") # add a regression line
```

---

### Exercise A 

```{r echo = FALSE,fig.width=10,fig.height=7}
# Scatter plot
plot(SA, SB, main="Scatter Plot of Scores by Panel Members A and B", 
     xlab="Scores by Panel Member A", ylab="Scores by Panel Member B", 
     pch=19, cex = 2.4,col="blue")
abline(lm(SB ~ SA), col="red") # add a regression line
```

---
### Exercise B. 

**Comment on the agreement in the two panel members‚Äô scores**

General Guidelines

- If the points lie close to a straight line, it indicates good agreement between the scores of the two panel members.

- The regression line helps to visualize the trend. If the points scatter widely around the plot, it indicates poor agreement.

Based on the scatter plot:

 - This plot indicates a fairly strong positive linear relationship, and hence broad agreement between the panel members.
 
---

### Exercise C.

**Calculate Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficient $r$ for these data**
```{r}
pearson_r <- cor(SA, SB)
pearson_r
```

---
### Exercise D.

**Calculate Spearman‚Äôs rank correlation coefficient $r_s$ for these data**

```{r}
spearman_rs <- cor(SA, SB, method = "spearman")
spearman_rs
```

---
### Exerice E.

**Calculate Kendall‚Äôs rank correlation coefficient $\tau$ for these data**

```{r}
kendall_tau <- cor(SA, SB, method = "kendall")
kendall_tau
```

---
### Exercise F.

**Comment on the suitability of the three correlation coefficients**

- **Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficient** measures the linear relationship between the scores.

- **Spearman‚Äôs rank correlation coefficient** measures the monotonic relationship between the scores, which is useful if the data is not normally distributed or if the relationship is not linear.

- **Kendall‚Äôs rank correlation coefficient** also measures the ordinal association between two quantities. It‚Äôs less sensitive to data with large discrepancies or outliers.

---

### Exercise G. 

**Perform three statistical tests for a suitable hypothesis of no association**

Here we test whether there is no association (null hypothesis) between the scores given by the two panel members. 
Three different correlation coefficients: Pearson's $r$, Spearman's $r_s$, and Kendall's $\tau$.

### Null and Alternative Hypotheses

For all three tests:

- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: There is no association between the scores of panel members A and B.

- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)**: There is an association between the scores of panel members A and B.

---

### Test using Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficient

```{r}

cor.test(SA, SB, method = "pearson")
```


---

### Test using Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficient

```{r}
pearson_test <- cor.test(SA, SB, method = "pearson")
pearson_test$p.value

```

#### Conclusion based on p-value

- p.value < 0.05

- Reject the null hypothesis. There is an association between the scores.

---

### Test using Spearman‚Äôs rank correlation coefficient

```{r}
cor.test(SA, SB, method = "spearman")
```

---

### Test using Spearman‚Äôs rank correlation coefficient


```{r}
spearman_test <- cor.test(SA, SB, method = "spearman")
spearman_test$p.value
```

#### Conclusion based on p-value

- p.value < 0.05

- Reject the null hypothesis. There is an association between the scores.

---

### Test using Kendall‚Äôs rank correlation coefficient

```{r}
cor.test(SA, SB, method = "kendall")
```

---

### Test using Kendall‚Äôs rank correlation coefficient

```{r}
kendall_test <- cor.test(SA, SB, method = "kendall")
kendall_test$p.value
```

#### Conclusion based on p-value

- p.value < 0.05

- Reject the null hypothesis. There is an association between the scores.


---

### Exercise G.


**Comment on the validity of the tests**

- **Pearson‚Äôs correlation test** assumes linearity and normality, which might not be suitable if these assumptions are violated.

- **Spearman‚Äôs and Kendall‚Äôs tests** are non-parametric and do not assume normality, making them more suitable for ordinal data or data with outliers.

```{r}
# (vii) Hypothesis testing
# Pearson's correlation test
cor.test(SA, SB, method = "pearson")

# Spearman's rank correlation test
cor.test(SA, SB, method = "spearman")

# Kendall's rank correlation test

# (viii) Comment on the validity of the tests
# ... (Discuss the assumptions of each test and their potential violations)
```

**Interpreting the Results:**

**Parts (i) and (ii):**
- A scatter plot can visually assess the agreement between the two sets of scores.
- A strong positive correlation would indicate high agreement, while a weak or negative correlation would suggest disagreement.

**Parts (iii) to (v):**
- Pearson's correlation measures the linear relationship between two continuous variables.
- Spearman's and Kendall's correlation coefficients measure the monotonic relationship between two ranked variables.

**Part (vi):**
- Pearson's correlation is suitable for interval data, while Spearman's and Kendall's are suitable for ordinal data.
- In this case, while the scores are technically on an interval scale, they might be better treated as ordinal due to potential non-linear relationships and subjective judgments.

**Part (vii):**
- The hypothesis tests for each correlation coefficient assess the null hypothesis of no correlation.
- The p-value indicates the significance of the correlation.
- A low p-value suggests a significant correlation.

**Part (viii):**
- The validity of the tests depends on the assumptions of each test.
- For example, Pearson's correlation assumes a linear relationship and normality.
- Spearman's and Kendall's correlation tests are more robust to deviations from normality.
- It's important to consider the nature of the data and the specific research question when choosing the appropriate test.

By following these steps and interpreting the results, you can gain insights into the agreement between the two panel members' scores and make informed decisions about the selection process.


This exercise focuses on evaluating the consistency and agreement between the scores given by two members of an interview panel to a sample of applicants. The goal is to understand how closely aligned the scoring of two panel members (A and B) is and to perform various statistical analyses to quantify this agreement.

### **Conclusion**
- By the end of this exercise, you will have a thorough understanding of how to evaluate the agreement between scores given by different individuals, calculate various correlation coefficients, and perform hypothesis tests to assess associations. This is particularly useful in contexts where multiple raters or judges are involved, such as hiring processes, performance evaluations, and research studies.
