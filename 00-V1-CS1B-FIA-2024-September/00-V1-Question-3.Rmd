3 A random variable X with values in the interval [0,1] has the following Cumulative
Distribution Function (CDF):
𝐹􁈺𝑥􁈻 􀵌 1 􀵆 􁈺1 􀵆 𝑥􀯔􁈻􀯕, 𝑥 ∈ 􁈾0,1􁈿
and inverse CDF:
𝐹􀬿􀬵􁈺𝑢􁈻 􀵌 􀵬1 􀵆 􁈺1 􀵆 𝑢􁈻
􀬵
􀯕􀵰
􀬵􀯔
where 𝑎 􀵐 0 and 𝑏 􀵐 0 are parameters. The Probability Density Function (PDF) is
then given by:
𝑓􁈺𝑥􁈻 􀵌 𝑎𝑏𝑥􀯔􀬿􀬵􁈺1 􀵆 𝑥􀯔􁈻􀯕􀬿􀬵, 𝑥 ∈ 􁈾0,1􁈿
You do not need to check the form of the inverse CDF or PDF.

Exercies

(i) Plot the inverse CDF 𝐹􀬿􀬵􁈺𝑢􁈻 for an appropriate range of values of u when
a = 0.7 and b = 0.5. [5]
􁈺ii􁈻 Simulate 1,000 values of X for a = 0.7 and b = 0.5 using the inverse transform
method and store the 1,000 simulated values in a vector in R for later use.

You must use the command set.seed(123) to initialise the random
number generator before you start the simulation. [3]
(iii) Plot a histogram of the 1,000 simulated values obtained in part (ii) using
relative frequencies. [2]
(iv) Plot the PDF f(x) of X for a = 0.7 and b = 0.5 for values of 𝑥 ∈ 􁈾0,1􁈿. The
graph of the PDF should be superimposed on the histogram produced in
part (iii). 

(v) Comment on the plot in part (iv) comparing the simulated values of X with the
PDF, also taking into account the size of the simulated sample. [2]
(vi) Plot the PDF f(x) of X for a = 0.7 and b = 0.5 for values of 𝑥 ∈ 􁈾0,1􁈿 in a new
plot, and add the PDF f(x) for a = 3 and b = 2 to the same plot. [4]
A statistician wants to use one of the PDFs in part (vi) as a prior density for a
Bayesian analysis.
(vii) Comment on the prior beliefs about the underlying parameter that the two
PDFs represent.
