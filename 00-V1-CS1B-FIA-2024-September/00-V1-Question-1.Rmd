1 For an investigation into the buying behaviour of consumers shopping at an online
store, data about the age, the time per month spent on the online shop’s website and
the number of purchases from the shop per year are recorded.
This dataset is saved in the file ‘onlineShop.Rdata’. After loading the data into R,
using the command load("onlineShop.RData"), the data frame
onlineShop will be available. The data frame onlineShop contains the
following three variables:
 age – the age (in years) of the customer
 time_spent_on_website – the time per month spent on the shop’s website
(in hours)
 purchases_per_year – the number of purchases from the shop per year.
(i) Fit a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) to the data assuming a Poisson
distribution with a log link function, using purchases_per_year as the
response variable and age and time_spent_on_website as explanatory
variables without an interaction term. Your answer should include the
estimated coefficients, the deviance and the Akaike’s Information Criterion
(AIC) of the fitted model. [4]
(ii) State an expression for the expected number of purchases per year in terms of
the variables age and time_spent_on_website using the fitted model
from part (i). [1]
It is suggested that a log link function may not be appropriate, and a square root link
function should be used instead, that is 𝑔􁈺𝜇􁈻 􀵌 √𝜇. In R, a square root link function
can be specified using family = poisson(link = "sqrt").
(iii) Fit a GLM to the data assuming a Poisson distribution with a square root link
function using purchases_per_year as the response variable and age
and time_spent_on_website as explanatory variables without an
interaction term. Your answer should include the estimated coefficients, the
deviance and the AIC of the fitted model. [4]
(iv) State an expression for the expected number of purchases per year in terms of
the variables age and time_spent_on_website using the fitted model
from part (iii). [1]
(v) Compare the models in parts (i) and (iii) and decide which model should be
preferred using the deviance. [1]
It is suggested that the deviance is not an appropriate measure to compare the two
models in parts (i) and (iii), and that the AIC should be used instead.
(vi) Comment on this suggestion in the context of comparing the two models in
parts (i) and (iii). In particular, identify any advantages that the AIC may
have compared to the deviance in this context. [2]
