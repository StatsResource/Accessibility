2 The dataset ‘CS2B_A24_Q2.csv’ contains four variables: Body Fat Index (BFI), age,
weight (in pounds) and height (in inches).
An analyst is considering fitting the following linear regression model that predicts
the BFI:
BFI􀯜 􀵌 𝛽􀬴 􀵅 𝛽􀬵Age􀯜 􀵅 𝛽􀬶Weight􀯜 􀵅 𝛽􀬷Height􀯜 􀵅 𝜀􀯜
The parameters can be fitted based on the following penalty function:
𝐿􁈺𝑩, 𝛼, 𝜆􁈻 􀵌 􀷍􁈺BFI􀯜 􀵆 𝛽􀬴 􀵆 𝛽􀬵Age􀯜 􀵆 𝛽􀬶Weight􀯜 􀵆 𝛽􀬷Height􀯜􁈻􀬶

where the vector of regression parameters, 𝑩 􀵌 􁈺𝛽􀬴, 𝛽􀬵, 𝛽􀬶, 𝛽􀬷􁈻 and 𝛼 and 𝜆 are some
parameters that are to be defined.
(i) State the type of the regression model if:
(a) 𝛼 􀵌 1.
(b) 𝛼 􀵌 0.

(ii) Construct R code to generate a dataframe named ‘BFI’ that includes the
contents of the file ‘CS2B_A24_Q2.csv’. 
Run the following two lines of code:
X=as.matrix(BFI[,-1])
Y=BFI[,1]
(iii) Comment briefly on each of these two lines of code. 
(iv) Construct R code to generate a function called ‘Penalty’ that calculates the
penalty function 𝐿􁈺𝑩, 𝛼, 𝜆􁈻 as above on the given data set, and with three input
variables:
𝑩 􀵌 􁈺𝛽􀬴, 𝛽􀬵, 𝛽􀬶, 𝛽􀬷􁈻 the vector of beta values
‘alpha’ as the parameter 𝛼
‘lambda’ as the value of 𝜆.

(v) Derive the value of the ‘Penalty’ function above for values of
𝑩 􀵌 􁉀1, 􀬵
􀬶 , 􀬵
􀬷 , 1􁉁, alpha = 0.5 and lambda = 0.8. 
(vi) Determine the values of alpha and lambda for which the ‘Penalty’ function is
minimised when 𝑩 􀵌 􁉀1, 􀬵
􀬶 , 􀬵
􀬷 , 1􁉁. You do not need to perform any additional
calculations. [4]

(viii) Determine the values of parameters α, λ and 𝑩 for which the function
𝐿􁈺𝑩, 𝛼, 𝜆􁈻 reaches its minimum based on the reasoning used in part (vi). [4]
(ix) Comment on the validity of using the values of parameters α, λ and 𝑩 from
part (viii). [5]
