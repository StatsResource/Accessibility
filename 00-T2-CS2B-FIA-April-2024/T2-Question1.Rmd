1 An insurer has written ten insurance policies under which, at most, one claim can be
made from each policy. The probability of a claim from policy i is as follows:
Pi = 0.1 + 0.02i for i = 1, 2, …, 10
Claim amounts for all policies follow the same Gamma distribution with shape
parameter α = 10 and rate parameter λ = 2.

probability of a claim for each policy using the seq function. 
B. Construct R code to calculate and display the theoretical mean and theoretical
standard deviation of the total claim amounts.

each of the ten policies, using a random number generator seed of 500 and
display the first five sets of simulations. 
D. Construct R code to generate and display a vector showing the mean and
standard deviation of claim amounts for each policy from the simulations
in exercise C.

the ten policies in this portfolio from the simulations in exercise C. and compare
these with your answers in exercise B.
F. Estimate, from the simulations in exercise C, the probability that there will be
no claims incurred from all ten policies. 
G. Calculate the 99th percentile of total claim amounts from the simulations in
part C.. 
H. Plot a histogram of the simulated total claim amounts, showing density on the
y-axis. 
I. Plot a density function of the Normal distribution using the parameter values
from part B. on top of the histogram in exercise H.

distribution in exercise I to approximate the total claims distribution. 
K. Comment on the appropriateness of using the Normal distribution in this case.

M. Comment on the appropriateness of using the Normal distribution in this new
case. 

### Steps for Analyzing Insurance Policies and Claim Amounts

### Exercise(i) Generate Probability of Claims for Each Policy

```r
# Generate and display probability of a claim for each policy using the seq function
probabilities <- seq(0.1 + 0.02, by = 0.02, length.out = 10)
print(probabilities)
```

### ExerciseB. Calculate Theoretical Mean and Standard Deviation of Total Claim Amounts

The claim amounts follow a Gamma distribution with shape parameter α = 10 and rate parameter λ = 2.

**Theoretical Mean and Standard Deviation**:
- Mean of a single policy claim amount: \( \alpha / \lambda$
- Variance of a single policy claim amount: \( \alpha / \lambda^2$

For the total claim amounts:
- Mean: \( \sum_{i=1}^{10} \text{probability}_i \times (\alpha / \lambda)$
- Variance: \( \sum_{i=1}^{10} \text{probability}_i \times (\alpha / \lambda^2)$


```r
alpha <- 10
lambda <- 2

# Calculate mean and variance of the total claim amounts
mean_total <- sum(probabilities * (alpha / lambda))
var_total <- sum(probabilities * (alpha / lambda^2))
sd_total <- sqrt(var_total)

cat("Theoretical Mean:", mean_total, "\n")
cat("Theoretical Standard Deviation:", sd_total, "\n")
```

### ExerciseC. Generate 1,000,000 Simulations of Claim Amounts


```r
set.seed(500)
n_simulations <- 1000000
claim_amounts <- matrix(0, nrow = n_simulations, ncol = 10)

for (i in 1:10) {
  claims <- rbinom(n_simulations, 1, probabilities[i]) * rgamma(n_simulations, alpha, rate = lambda)
  claim_amounts[, i] <- claims
}

# Display the first five sets of simulations
head(claim_amounts, 5)
```

### ExerciseD. Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation of Claim Amounts from Simulations


```r
means_simulated <- apply(claim_amounts, 2, mean)
sds_simulated <- apply(claim_amounts, 2, sd)

cat("Simulated Means:\n", means_simulated, "\n")
cat("Simulated Standard Deviations:\n", sds_simulated, "\n")
```

### ExerciseE. Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation of Total Claim Amounts from Simulations


```r
total_claims <- rowSums(claim_amounts)
mean_total_simulated <- mean(total_claims)
sd_total_simulated <- sd(total_claims)

cat("Simulated Total Mean:", mean_total_simulated, "\n")
cat("Simulated Total Standard Deviation:", sd_total_simulated, "\n")
```

**Comparison**:
- Theoretical Mean: \( \text{calculated in B}$
- Simulated Mean: \( \text{calculated here}$

### ExerciseF. Estimate Probability of No Claims from All Policies


```r
prob_no_claims <- mean(rowSums(claim_amounts) == 0)
cat("Probability of No Claims:", prob_no_claims, "\n")
```

### Exercise G. Calculate the 99th Percentile of Total Claim Amounts from Simulations


```r
percentile_99 <- quantile(total_claims, 0.99)
cat("99th Percentile of Total Claims:", percentile_99, "\n")
```

### Exercise H. 

**Plot a Histogram of Simulated Total Claim Amounts**


```r
hist(total_claims, freq = FALSE, main = "Histogram of Simulated Total Claim Amounts", xlab = "Total Claim Amounts", ylab = "Density")
```

---

### Exercise I. 

**Plot Density Function of Normal Distribution on Top of Histogram**


```r
# Plot the histogram
hist(total_claims, freq = FALSE, main = "Histogram of Simulated Total Claim Amounts with Normal Distribution", xlab = "Total Claim Amounts", ylab = "Density")
# Plot the normal distribution
x <- seq(min(total_claims), max(total_claims), length = 1000)
lines(x, dnorm(x, mean = mean_total, sd = sd_total), col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

---

### Exercise J. 

**Calculate the 99th Percentile Using the Normal Distribution**


```r
percentile_99_normal <- qnorm(0.99, mean = mean_total, sd = sd_total)
cat("99th Percentile of Total Claims (Normal Distribution):", percentile_99_normal, "\n")
```

### ExerciseK. Comment on the Appropriateness of Using the Normal Distribution

- The Normal distribution may not be a perfect fit if the data is skewed or has heavy tails. 
- Visual comparison of the histogram and the Normal density function can help in assessing the fit.
- Differences between the simulated 99th percentile and the Normal approximation provide further insight.

### ExerciseL. Plot a Graph with Different Claim Probabilities (Pi = 0.4 + 0.02i)


```r
probabilities_new <- seq(0.4 + 0.02, by = 0.02, length.out = 10)

# Generate new simulations
set.seed(500)
claim_amounts_new <- matrix(0, nrow = n_simulations, ncol = 10)

for (i in 1:10) {
  claims_new <- rbinom(n_simulations, 1, probabilities_new[i]) * rgamma(n_simulations, alpha, rate = lambda)
  claim_amounts_new[, i] <- claims_new
}

total_claims_new <- rowSums(claim_amounts_new)

# Plot the histogram
hist(total_claims_new, freq = FALSE, main = "Histogram of Simulated Total Claim Amounts (New Probabilities)", xlab = "Total Claim Amounts", ylab = "Density")
# Plot the normal distribution
lines(x, dnorm(x, mean = mean(total_claims_new), sd = sd(total_claims_new)), col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

### ExerciseM. Comment on the Appropriateness of Using the Normal Distribution in the New Case

- The increased probabilities may lead to a better fit for the Normal distribution due to reduced skewness.
- As more policies are likely to have claims, the Central Limit Theorem may be more applicable.
- Visual and numerical comparisons similar to previous steps can help assess the fit.
