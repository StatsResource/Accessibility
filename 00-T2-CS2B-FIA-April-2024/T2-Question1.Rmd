1 An insurer has written ten insurance policies under which, at most, one claim can be
made from each policy. The probability of a claim from policy i is as follows:
Pi = 0.1 + 0.02i for i = 1, 2, …, 10
Claim amounts for all policies follow the same Gamma distribution with shape
parameter α = 10 and rate parameter λ = 2.
(i) Construct R code to generate and display a single vector setting out the
probability of a claim for each policy using the seq function. 
(ii) Construct R code to calculate and display the theoretical mean and theoretical
standard deviation of the total claim amounts. 
(iii) Construct R code to generate 1,000,000 simulations of claim amounts under
each of the ten policies, using a random number generator seed of 500 and
display the first five sets of simulations. [6]
(iv) Construct R code to generate and display a vector showing the mean and
standard deviation of claim amounts for each policy from the simulations
in part (iii). [3]
(v) Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the total claim amounts from
the ten policies in this portfolio from the simulations in part (iii) and compare
these with your answers in part (ii). [4]
(vi) Estimate, from the simulations in part (iii), the probability that there will be
no claims incurred from all ten policies. 
(vii) Calculate the 99th percentile of total claim amounts from the simulations in
part (iii). 
(viii) Plot a histogram of the simulated total claim amounts, showing density on the
y-axis. 
(ix) Plot a density function of the Normal distribution using the parameter values
from part (ii) on top of the histogram in part (viii). 
(x) Calculate the 99th percentile of total claim amounts using the Normal
distribution in part (ix) to approximate the total claims distribution. 
(xi) Comment on the appropriateness of using the Normal distribution in this case.

(xii) Plot a graph similar to the one in part (ix), but with the probability of a claim
from policy i as follows:
Pi = 0.4 + 0.02i for i = 1, 2, …, 10
[3]
(xiii) Comment on the appropriateness of using the Normal distribution in this new
case. [3]
