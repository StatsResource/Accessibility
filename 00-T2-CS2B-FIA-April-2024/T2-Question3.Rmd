CS2B A2024–5
3 A study has been made into how long in weeks it takes for long distance athletes who
suffer ankle injuries to recover and be able to run again.
The datafile ‘CS2B_A24_Q3.csv’ contains data on a group of such athletes where the
information recorded for each one is:
 time = the number of weeks before recovery or censoring occurs.
 leave = 0 if the person leaves the study before full recovery, or 1 if time to full
recovery is recorded.
 route = 0 if the person was treated with pain relief drugs and told to rest, or 1 if
they were on a program of physiotherapy instead of the drugs.
 prior = 1 if there had been another ankle injury in the last 36 months, or 0
otherwise.
Before you start this question, you will need to install the survival package in R:
install.packages("survival")
library(survival)
(i) Construct R code to generate a dataframe named ‘study’ that includes the
contents of the file ‘CS2B_A24_Q3.csv’ and display the first twelve rows. 
(ii) State an example of how censoring in this study may be informative or
non-informative for each treatment route. 
(iii) Generate R code to calculate the Kaplan–Meier estimate of the survival
function for the length of time to recovery separately for athletes who take
pain relief drugs and those on a physiotherapy programme, and plot the
resulting two survival functions using different coloured lines in a single
plot. [8]
(iv) Explain what conclusions can be drawn from your results in part (iii). [3]
(v) Construct R code to generate a Cox’s proportional hazard model with two
covariates, ‘route’ and ‘prior’. You should use the Breslow method for tie
handling and display the resulting regression coefficients. [6]
(vi) Comment on what conclusions can be drawn from your answer to part (v)
about whether treatment route or prior injury is more important in predicting
length of time to recovery. [4]
(vii) State how you could test which of the two covariates is more important.
