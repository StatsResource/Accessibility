* The emphasis is placed on being able to apply statistical methods to actuarial problems using real data sets and the open-source software environment R. 

* Time Series. Probability Distributions, Survival Analysis

1 The ‘CS2B_Sept_21_Qu_1_Data.csv’ file contains mortality data for a particular 
population of females in the year 1921, taken from the Human Mortality Database. 
The file contains the following three variables:
Age Age, 𝑥, in single years from 25 to 90 
mu_x Crude values of the forces of mortality at age x, μ௫
Exposed_x Exposed to risk at age 𝑥 nearest birthday 
Before answering this question, the ‘CS2B_Sept_21_Qu_1_Data.csv’ file should be 
loaded into R and assigned to a data frame called mortalitydata. 
(i) Plot the crude values of μ௫ against age, x, using a line graph.  
(ii) Comment on the age pattern of the crude values of μx
 shown in the graph in 
part (i).  
The Gompertz law of mortality can be expressed as follows: 
μx
 = Bcx
(iii) Perform a graduation of the crude values of μ௫ using the Gompertz formula, 
specifying the values of B and c in your answer script. [7] 
(iv) Perform a chi-square goodness-of-fit test of the graduated values of μx
 from 
part (iii) using a 95% confidence level. [9]

(ii)
EITHER:
The mu_x’s increase with age 
increasing rapidly from age 60 onwards 
OR:
The mu_x’s increase approximately exponentially with age 
THEN:
They exhibit some roughness 
especially between ages 70 and 85 years 
They should be graduated before being used 
(iii)
EITHER:
GompModel = lm( 
log(mu_x) 
~ Age, 
data = mortalitydata) 
OR
GompModel = lm( 
log(mortalitydata$mu_x) 
~ mortalitydata$Age) 
THEN EITHER:

And hence:

Residual standard error: 0.2718 on 64 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared: 0.9586, Adjusted R-squared: 0.958 
F-statistic: 1483 on 1 and 64 DF, p-value: < 2.2e-16 

The fitted Gompertz formula for ln(mu_x) is therefore:
ln (mu_x) = -7.867787 + 0.067630x 
And hence: 
B = 0.0003829 
c = 1.0699693 
(iv)
The null hypothesis is that the Gompertz graduated rates are the true rates underlying the 
observed data 
The alternative hypothesis is that the Gompertz graduated rates are NOT the true rates 
underlying the observed data

 114.8394 
The test statistic has a chi-square distribution with m degrees of freedom, where m is
the number of age groups less one for each Gompertz parameter fitted
So, in this case m = 66 - 2 = 64. 
THEN EITHER:
The critical value at the 5% level with 64 degrees of freedom is:
qchisq(0.95, 64)
 83.67526
OR:
Using Page 169 of the Golden Book, the critical value at the 5% level with 70 degrees
of freedom is 90.53 and so the critical value with 64 degrees of freedom is less than this

Since 114.8394 > critical value 
there IS enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level
