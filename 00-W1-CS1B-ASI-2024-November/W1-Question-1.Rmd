### Exercise A


Consider a random sample X1, X2, …….., Xn from a Chi-Square distribution with 2 
degrees of freedom and define Y = ∑ Xi n
 i=1  
   
i) State the distribution of Y, giving all the parameters of the distribution. 

---

Certainly! Let's analyze the distribution of \( Y \):

Given a random sample \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \) from a Chi-Square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom, \( X_i \sim \chi^2(2) \).

To define \( Y = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \):

### Distribution of \( Y \)

1. **Individual Distribution**:
   - Each \( X_i \) follows a Chi-Square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom.
   - \( X_i \sim \chi^2(2) \)

2. **Gamma Distribution**:
   - A Chi-Square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom is equivalent to a Gamma distribution with shape parameter \( \alpha = 1 \) and rate parameter \( \lambda = \frac{1}{2} \).
   - \( X_i \sim \text{Gamma}(1, \frac{1}{2}) \)

3. **Sum of Gamma Distributions**:
   - The sum of \( n \) Gamma-distributed random variables with the same rate parameter \( \lambda \) but shape parameter \( \alpha \) is also Gamma-distributed with shape parameter equal to the sum of the individual shape parameters, and the same rate parameter.
   - Therefore, \( Y \) follows a Gamma distribution with shape parameter \( n \) and rate parameter \( \frac{1}{2} \).

4. **Parameters of \( Y \)**:
   - \( Y \sim \text{Gamma}(n, \frac{1}{2}) \)

So, the distribution of \( Y \) is Gamma with parameters \( n \) (shape) and \( \frac{1}{2} \) (rate).

### Exercise B.


Following 15 random numbers have been generated from a $U(0,1)$ distribution using <tt>R</tt>. 
 
<pre><code> 
0.07991847, 0.82064314, 0.33683219, 0.93005953, 0.31919393, 
0.92695533, 0.76263949, 0.51740370, 0.49224880, 0.46354694, 
0.89832157, 0.21920729, 0.20471780, 0.19055074, 0.69137537  
</code></pre> 

Using the 15 random numbers provided above, simulate a sample $x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_{15}$ from a 
chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. 

Based on this sample, calculate the 
value of Y.  

---

### Exercise B 

**Simulating the Sample**

Simulation and Transformation:

   - Using a set of uniform random numbers, simulate a sample from a given distribution.
   
   - Transform uniform random numbers to follow a Chi-Square distribution using R functions such as `qchisq`.

---

### Exercise B 

**Simulating the Sample**
Using the 15 given uniform random numbers to simulate a sample from the chi-square distribution:

```{r}
# Given uniform random numbers
u_ran <- c(0.07991847, 0.82064314, 0.33683219, 0.93005953, 0.31919393, 
           0.92695533, 0.76263949, 0.51740370, 0.49224880, 0.46354694, 
           0.89832157, 0.21920729, 0.20471780, 0.19055074, 0.69137537)

# Generating a sample from chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom
x <- qchisq(u_ran, 2)
print(x)
```

---
  
```{r}
# Calculating Y
y <- sum(x)
print(y)
```

---

### Exercise C.

Using the values of x1, ……., xn generated in part (ii), test whether the standard deviation 
of X is equal to 2.5 from first principle using <tt>qchisq()<tt> to determine the critical values and 
pchisq() function to determine the p-value. Clearly state the null and alternate 
hypothesis, the p-value and the conclusion of the test. Perform the test at 5% level of 
significance.  

---

Sure, let's get started on testing whether the standard deviation of \(X\) is equal to 2.5 using a Chi-square test. Here is a step-by-step approach:

### 1. State the hypotheses:
- **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))**: \(\sigma = 2.5\) (The standard deviation of \(X\) is 2.5)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\))**: \(\sigma \neq 2.5\) (The standard deviation of \(X\) is not 2.5)

### 2. Calculate the test statistic:
The test statistic for the Chi-square test for standard deviation is given by:
\[
\chi^2 = \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma_0^2}
\]
where:
- \(n\) is the number of observations.
- \(s\) is the sample standard deviation.
- \(\sigma_0\) is the hypothesized standard deviation (2.5 in this case).

### 3. Determine the critical values:
Using the Chi-square distribution, find the critical values at the 5% significance level. These can be found using the `qchisq()` function in R.

### 4. Compute the p-value:
The p-value can be determined using the `pchisq()` function in R, which gives the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the value calculated under the null hypothesis.

### 5. Conclusion:
Compare the p-value to the significance level (0.05) to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.

Here is a sample R code for performing the Chi-square test:

```r
# Sample data
x <- c(x1, x2, ..., xn)  # replace with actual data

# Calculate sample size and standard deviation
n <- length(x)
s <- sd(x)

# Hypothesized standard deviation
sigma0 <- 2.5

# Calculate the test statistic
chi_square_stat <- (n-1) * s^2 / sigma0^2

# Critical values at 5% significance level
alpha <- 0.05
chi_square_critical_lower <- qchisq(alpha/2, df=n-1)
chi_square_critical_upper <- qchisq(1 - alpha/2, df=n-1)

# p-value
p_value <- 2 * min(pchisq(chi_square_stat, df=n-1), 1 - pchisq(chi_square_stat, df=n-1))

# Conclusion
if(p_value < alpha) {
  conclusion <- "Reject the null hypothesis (H0). The standard deviation is significantly different from 2.5."
} else {
  conclusion <- "Fail to reject the null hypothesis (H0). There is no significant evidence to suggest that the standard deviation is different from 2.5."
}

# Results
list(
  chi_square_stat = chi_square_stat,
  critical_values = c(chi_square_critical_lower, chi_square_critical_upper),
  p_value = p_value,
  conclusion = conclusion
)
```

Replace `c(x1, x2, ..., xn)` with your actual data points. This code will give you the test statistic, critical values, p-value, and the conclusion of the test.

If you have any specific data points or any further questions, feel free to share, and I'll be happy to help!

### Exercise C.

**Hypothesis Testing**

Test whether the standard deviation of $X$ is equal to 2.5 using the chi-square test:

- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): $\text{SD}(X) = 2.5$

- Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$): $\text{SD}(X) \neq 2.5$

- Level of significance ($\alpha$): 0.05

---

R code for the hypothesis test:

```{r}
n <- length(x)
sigma <- 2.5
alpha <- 0.05
statistic <- (n-1) * var(x) / sigma^2
print(statistic)
```

---

### Exercise C.

```{r}

# Critical values
lower_critical <- qchisq(alpha/2, n-1)
upper_critical <- qchisq(alpha/2, n-1, lower=FALSE)
print(lower_critical)
print(upper_critical)
```

---

### Exercise C.

```{r}
# p-value
p_value <- 2 * pchisq(statistic, df=n-1)
print(p_value)
```

---


**iii) Hypothesis Testing**

- Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\)): Standard deviation of $X$ is equal to 2.5.
- Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\)): Standard deviation of $X$ is not equal to 2.5.
    - Critical values: $\chi^2$ at $\alpha/2$ and $\chi^2$ at $\alpha/2$ (lower=FALSE).
    - Calculated statistic: 7.305598.
    - p-value: 0.1554235, which is greater than 0.05, so we do not reject $H_0$.


---

```{r}
# Conclusion
if (p_value < alpha) {
  print("Reject H0: The standard deviation of X is not equal to 2.5.")
} else {
  print("Do not reject H0: There is not sufficient evidence to conclude the standard deviation is different from 2.5.")
}
```

---

### Exercise C.

> #p-value 
> 2*(pchisq((n-1)*var(x)/sigma^2,df=n-1)) 
[1] 0.1554235 


As the p-value is > 5%, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and 
hence we can conclude that the standard deviation of X is equal to 2.5.  



---

### Exercise D.

Write and execute R script to generate 1,000 samples of x of size 15. Then, calculate the 
sum of 1,000 corresponding values of Y based on these samples. Use set.seed(47) and 
print the sum of 1,000 y values.

<br>

### Exercise D.

We need to write a code to obtain sample for y with 1,000 simulations. Following code as 
given the question can be used for that: 

---

### Exercise D. 

**Generating 1,000 Samples and Calculating Sum**

Generate 1,000 samples and calculate the sum of corresponding $Y$ values:

```{r}
set.seed(47)
y <- numeric(1000)

for (i in 1:1000) {
   y[i] <- sum(rchisq(15, 2))
}

total_sum_y <- sum(y)
print(total_sum_y)
```

Run the above R script to get the sum of 1,000 $Y$ values based on the samples generated.


- For 1,000 simulations of $Y$, code and results indicated the sum was approximately 30,508.66.

N <- 1000 # One Thousand

set.seed(47)
y <- numeric(N)

for (i in 1:N) {
   y[i] <- sum(rchisq(15, 2))
}

# Plot the histogram
hist(y, breaks = 25, freq = FALSE, main = "Histogram of Y with Normal Curve", 
     xlab = "Values of Y", col = "lightblue", border = "black")

# Fit and plot the normal curve

curve(dnorm(x, mean = mean_y, sd = sd_y), add = TRUE, col = "darkblue", lwd = 2)

```

***1000 Iterations: Sample Size of 15***

```{r echo=FALSE}

N <- 1000 # No. of Iterations
samplesize =15 # Sample Size in each iteration

set.seed(47)
y <- numeric(N)

for (i in 1:N) {
   y[i] <- sum(rchisq(15, 2))
}

# Plot the histogram
hist(y, breaks = 25, freq = FALSE, 
     main = "Histogram of Y with Normal Curve", 
     xlab = "Values of Y", col = "lightblue", 
     border = "black")

# Fit and plot the normal curve
mean_y <- mean(y)
sd_y <- sd(y)
curve(dnorm(x, mean = mean_y, sd = sd_y), add = TRUE, col = "darkblue", lwd = 2)

```

}

# Plot the histogram

}

# Plot the histogram

mean_y <- mean(y)
sd_y <- sd(y)
curve(dnorm(x, mean = mean_y, sd = sd_y), add = TRUE, 
      col = "darkblue", lwd = 2)

```

### Comment on the Difference Between the Two Histograms

For **sample size 15**:
- The histogram for $Y$ with a sample size of 15 is likely to be skewed or not perfectly symmetrical.

- This skewness occurs because with a smaller sample size, the distribution of $Y$ retains more of the original shape of the chi-square distribution, which is itself not symmetrical.

For **sample size 10,000**:
- The histogram for $Y$ with a sample size of 10,000 tends to be more symmetrical and closer to a normal distribution.

- This is due to the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sum (or average) of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution of the variables.

- As the sample size increases, the distribution of the sum $Y$ approaches normality, resulting in a bell-shaped curve.

---

### R Code to Generate Sample Means and Variances

Here’s the R code to generate the sample means $\bar{X}$ and sample variances $S^2$ for 1,000 random samples of $Y$, each having 10,000 values of \(x\):

```{r}
set.seed(47)

# Initialize vectors to store sample means and variances
x_bar <- numeric(1000)
s_squared <- numeric(1000)

```

---

```{r}
# Generate the samples and calculate means and variances
for (i in 1:1000) {
  sample_x <- rchisq(10000, 2)
  x_bar[i] = mean(sample_x)
  s_squared[i] = var(sample_x)
}

# Print results
print(mean(x_bar))
print(mean(s_squared))
```

This code sets the seed for reproducibility, initializes the vectors to store the sample means and variances, and then uses a loop to generate 1,000 random samples of \(X\) (each of size 10,000), calculates the mean and variance for each sample, and stores them in the vectors `x_bar` and `s_squared`.


---

**vii) Sample Mean and Variance**

- Mean of sample means: Close to 2.
- Mean of sample variances: Close to 4.
- $X_{\text{bar}}$ is an unbiased estimator of population mean $\mu$.
- $S^2$ is an unbiased estimator of population variance $\sigma^2$.

---

**viii) Comments**

- Plot of $X_{\text{bar}}$ indicates normality, true for large sample sizes.
- Plot of $\Sigma^2$ is less normal compared to $X_{\text{bar}}$.

We have Xi ~  χ2 with 2 degrees of freedom.

The distribution of Y when sample size = 15, is not perfectly symmetrical like a normal 
distribution. This is given because Y seems to accept only positive values as gamma 
distribution is defined only when y>0. 
However, when sample size = 10,000 this histogram is symmetrical and is closer to a normal 
distribution. 
As n tends to infinity, using central limit theorem, the distribution of the sample approaches a 
normal distribution.  

---
For a larger sample size of n (changed from 15 to 10,000) the central limit theorem ensures 
that the distribution of Y becomes approximately normal.  
By modifying the code in part (iv), we generate 10,000 values of x and calculate the sample 
mean and sample variance for each sample.

Also, by visual inspection we can see that the mean of the sample means is close to 2.

* Population mean is 2 (number of degrees of freedom of the variable Xi which has chi-square 
distribution). Since E(X_bar) = mu, we can conclude that X_bar is an unbiased estimator of 
population mean mu.

* Also, by visual inspection we can see that the mean of the sample variances is close to 4. 
 
* Population variance is 4 (2 times the number of degrees of freedom of the variable Xi which 
has chi-square distribution). 

* Since E(S2) = sigma2, we can conclude that S2 is an unbiased 
estimator of population variance sigma2.

### Exercise H.

The plot of X_bar is indicative of normality. This is true as for large sample size, X_bar ~ 
N(mu, sigma2 / n).  
 
However, plot of Sigma_squared is relatively less normal as compared to plot of X_bar.
