Solution 1: 
i) 
ii) 
We know the property that if W ~ Gamma(α,ʎ) then 2ʎW has χ2 distribution with 2α degrees 
of freedom. 
We have Xi ~  χ2 with 2 degrees of freedom. 
Xi / 2ʎ ~ Gamma(1,ʎ) 
We further know that for a chi-square distribution, ʎ = ½  
Xi  ~ Gamma(1,½) 
Hence, Xi ~ Exp(½)  
�
�
 Y = ∑ 𝑋𝑖
 𝑖=1 
Hence, Y ~ Gamma (n,½           
variable  
……… Gamma distribution with parameters α=1 and ʎ 
is an exponential distribution with parameter ʎ  
First copy the numbers in R and define a vector u_ran. 
Then using qchisq function convert these uniform random numbers into random numbers 
from a chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. 
R Code and Output: 
……….. Sum of ‘n’ exponential variables is a gamma

iii) 
H0: Standard deviation of X is equal to 2.5. 
H1: Standard deviation of X is not equal to 2.5.

As the p-value is > 5%, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and 
hence we can conclude that the standard deviation of X is equal to 2.5.

v) 
vi) 
We need to write a code to obtain sample for y with 1,000 simulations. Following code as 
given the question can be used for that: 
R Code and Output: 
> set.seed(47) 
> y = 0*(1:1000) 
> for(i in 1:1000){ 
+   y[i] = sum(rchisq(15,2)) 
+ } 
> sum(y) 
[1] 30508.66 
The distribution of Y when sample size = 15, is not perfectly symmetrical like a normal 
distribution. This is given because Y seems to accept only positive values as gamma 
distribution is defined only when y>0. 
However, when sample size = 10,000 this histogram is symmetrical and is closer to a normal 
distribution. 
As n tends to infinity, using central limit theorem, the distribution of the sample approaches a 
normal distribution.  
For a larger sample size of n (changed from 15 to 10,000) the central limit theorem ensures 
that the distribution of Y becomes approximately normal.  
By modifying the code in part (iv), we generate 10,000 values of x and calculate the sample 
mean and sample variance for each sample. 
R Code and Output: 
> set.seed(47) 
> x_bar = 0*(1:1000) 
> s_squared = 0*(1:1000) 
> for(i in 1:1000){ 
+   x_bar[i] = mean(rchisq(10000,2)) 
+   s_squared[i] = var(rchisq(10000,2))

Also, by visual inspection we can see that the mean of the sample means is close to 2. 
 
Population mean is 2 (number of degrees of freedom of the variable Xi which has chi-square 
distribution). Since E(X_bar) = mu, we can conclude that X_bar is an unbiased estimator of 
population mean mu. 
 
> print(mean(s_squared)) 
[1] 3.995956 
 
Also, by visual inspection we can see that the mean of the sample variances is close to 4. 
 
Population variance is 4 (2 times the number of degrees of freedom of the variable Xi which 
has chi-square distribution). Since E(S2) = sigma2, we can conclude that S2 is an unbiased 
estimator of population variance sigma2. (4) 
   
viii) Comment: 
The plot of X_bar is indicative of normality. This is true as for large sample size, X_bar ~ 
N(mu, sigma2 / n).  
 
However, plot of Sigma_squared is relatively less normal as compared to plot of X_bar. (2)
