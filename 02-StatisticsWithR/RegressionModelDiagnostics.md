#### Diagnosing a Linear Regression
The ease of implementation fosters the impression that linear regression is easy: just use the \texttt{\textbf{lm()}} function. Yet fitting
this is only the beginning.

After a linear regression analysis has been performed. It is good practice to verify the modelâ€™s quality
by running diagnostic checks.

The approach we will take is to create diagnostic plots, by plotting the model object. Rather than producing a scatterplot, this method will produce several diagnostic plots:

```


```R

attach(iris)
Fit1 <- lm(Sepal.length ~ Sepal.Width)
plot(Fit1)


```





```R
####Influence Measures
Finally, identify any overly influential observations by using the \texttt{\textbf{influence.measures()}} 
function.
If an observation is considered influential, it will be indicated with an asterisk on the right hand side. Interpretation of the individual statistics, such as \textit{DFFITS} and \textit{DFBETA} are beyond the scope of this course.

```


```R



\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
influence.measures(Fit1)
\end{verbatim} 
\end{framed}

\end{document}
```
