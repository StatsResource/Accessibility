6.
In an experiment in which the subject of interest was the effect on weight gain of
different amounts and types of protein, six groups of 10 male rats each were given
diets that contained two levels of protein and three different types of protein. The
mean weight gains (in grams) are shown in the table below.

(i) Explain what is meant by interaction. Draw a suitable plot for the data above
and comment on whether there appears to be any interaction between the type
and level of protein used in the animals' diet.

Interaction is when factors (here, the level and type of protein) do not appear to function independently. Here all the types – A, B, C – give an increase in mean weight gain with increasing level (although the behaviour of B is rather different from A and C). There is unlikely to be a large interaction – if there is any.

2.  Based on the animals' individual weights, the analysis of variance for this
experiment is shown below. Complete the table. Explain carefully the
interpretation of the F ratios. Comment on the relationship between your
conclusions and the plot in (i).

*  Upper critical points of F1,50 and F2,50 are taken from the Society's statistical tables for use in examinations. Values for (1, 54) and (2, 54) will be very similar.

*  The F value for level is very highly significant; we have very strong evidence that the two levels of protein do not result in the same overall mean weight gain.
*  The F value for type is insignificant. We have no evidence to suggest that the three protein types are different in terms of the overall mean weight gain.
*  Similarly, we have no evidence that there is any interaction, i.e. that any protein type behaves differently as level is increased (even though the B responses are somewhat different from those of A and C). 
*  The graph in part (i) shows the pattern, and the analysis here confirms which are the significant sources of variation.

3. 
Calculate the proportion of overall variation in the data explained by the fitted
model, and the estimated underlying residual variance. Comment on your
answers.


*  The 5 degrees of freedom for factors and interaction explain only 28.4\% of the total variation (SS total). This is uncomfortably small.
*  We note also that the estimate of experimental error is 2ˆσ = 214.56 (ˆσ = 14.65), which is quite large compared with the values of the observations themselves (of order 100).
*  Perhaps it is simply the case that the weight gains are naturally very variable; or perhaps they are influenced by other covariates (e.g. initial weight).
*  
The dependence of weight gain on protein level appears strong and is intuitively appealing. But there may be more to learn about the response variable.
